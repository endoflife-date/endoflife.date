> [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) is a free operating system for your computer. The Debian stable
> branch is the most popular edition for personal computers and network servers, and is used as the
> basis for many other Linux distributions.

At any given time, there is one stable release of Debian, which has the support of the Debian
security team. When a new stable version is released, the security team will usually cover the
previous version for a year or so, while they also cover the new/current version. Only stable is
recommended for production use.

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of
all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years on [a limited set of
architectures](https://lts-team.pages.debian.net/wiki/FAQ.html#what-architectures-are-supported).
Debian LTS will not be handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers
and companies. Not all packages of the Debian archive are supported by LTS, the
[debian-security-support](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Using#Check_for_unsupported_packages) package
can check for unsupported packages.

A commercial offering for [Extended Long Term Support (ELTS)](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Extended)
is also available to further extend the lifetime of Debian releases to 10 years (5 supplementary
years after the 5 years offered by the LTS project). It is not an official Debian project.
