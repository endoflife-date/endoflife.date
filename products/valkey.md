> [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) is an open source (BSD) high-performance key/value datastore
> that supports a variety of workloads such as caching, message queues,
> and can act as a primary database. Valkey can run as either a standalone
> daemon or in a cluster, with options for replication and high availability.

The Valkey community typically releases a stable major version once each year.
Stable minor versions are introduced as needed between major releases,
with at least one minor version published annually.
