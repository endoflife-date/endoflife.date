> Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a Linux distribution developed by Red Hat for the commercial market.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 5, 6, and 7 each deliver ten years of support in Full Support, Maintenance Support 1 and Maintenance Support 2 Phases followed by an Extended Life Phase. In addition, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, customers may purchase annual Add-on subscriptions called Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) to extend limited subscription services beyond the Maintenance Support 2 Phase.

With the introduction of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8, Red Hat is simplifying the RHEL product phases from four to three: Full Support, Maintenance Support, and Extended Life Phase.

The Security Support dates in the above table use "Maintenance Support" as the end of security support.
