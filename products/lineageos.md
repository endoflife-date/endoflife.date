> [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) is a mobile operating system based on Android.

LineageOS maintains two versions at the same time. Devices that are not ported to one of the two
latest versions stop being supported. A list of supported devices is available at the [LineageOS
Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/).

Some devices that weren't upgraded to 19.1 or 20.0 are still getting 18.1 monthly updates with
latest Android Security Patch.

Some old branches may still get security updates via Android Security Patches, but users will have
to do their own builds to get these updates - official builds are only maintained for the last two
versions (with the exception of devices stuck on 18.1). For details, please visit [LineageOS Gerrit](https://review.lineageos.org/)
to check commits.
