> [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is an open source message broker written in Erlang that
> supports multiple messaging protocols.

- **Community Support**: includes regular patch releases. Was earlier called "General Support", but
  renamed to avoid confusion with [VMware terminology](https://tanzu.vmware.com/support/lifecycle_policy)
  related to support lifecycle policy.
- **[Extended Commercial Support](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq)**: is available from VMWare. It includes
  security patches, and fixes for high-severity issues reported by users with a commercial license.
