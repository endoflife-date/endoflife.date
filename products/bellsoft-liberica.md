> [BellSoft Liberica JDK](https://bell-sw.com/libericajdk/) is a [GPLv2 with CPE](https://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html)
> licensed build of the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK) that is tested and verified to be
> compliant with the Java SE specification using OpenJDK Technology Compatibility Kit test suite for
> Linux, Windows, macOS, and Solaris operating systems.

Liberica JDK builds are available for Java 6 and greater. It follows the same cadence as OpenJDK:

- a 6-month rapid-release cycle since the release of Java 10,
- a new LTS release every 3 years (every sixth OpenJDK release) after the release of OpenJDK 11,
- a new LTS release every 2 years (every fourth OpenJDK release) after the release of OpenJDK 17.

Following the upstream OpenJDK project, Liberica JDK updates are released quarterly. LTS versions
are supported at least 2 years (but usually much more), and non-LTS are only supported for 6 months.

For LTS releases, [commercial support can be purchased](https://bell-sw.com/roadmap/) with at least
8 years (from the initial release) of access to bug fixes, security updates, and other fixes as
needed.

Liberica JDK is one of the many builds of OpenJDK. For recommendations on which JDK build to use,
