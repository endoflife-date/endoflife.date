> MikroTik [RouterOS](https://mikrotik.com/software) is a Linux-derived OS for RouterBOARD devices.

RouterOS is a stand-alone operating system based on Linux kernel. It powers MikroTik hardware devices, but is also available for virtual machines.
It can also be installed on a PC and will turn it into a router with all the necessary features - routing, firewall, bandwidth management, wireless access point, backhaul link, hotspot gateway, VPN server and more.

See the [homepage](https://mikrotik.com/software), [forum](https://forum.mikrotik.com/c/routeros/6), [help docs](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/), or [old wiki](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/) for further information.

Note: When performing updates each minor version must be upgraded in sequence.

## Support Policy
Offered on MikroTik product pages:
> The device has an operating system preinstalled and licensed. No separate purchase is necessary and the product is ready to use. The device includes free software updates for the life of the product or a minimum of 5 years starting from date of purchase.

From the forum:
> Long-term release channel (presently v6) only receives security updates. At present, there is no long-term for V7. MikroTik support policy is limited to bugs and interoperability/incompatibility, not configuration help.
