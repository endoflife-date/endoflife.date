> [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/) is a desktop-oriented GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian's stable branch releases. MX Linux uses the [XFCE](https://xfce.org/) by default and aims for "an elegant and efficient desktop with simple configuration, high stability, solid performance and medium-sized footprint."

There are several releases of MX Linux supported concurrently.  These typically follow Debian's periods of active development and extended long-term support, which provides security patches to a limited set of packages.  Often this equates to ~2 years of active support and 2 years of long-term security patch support.

MX Linux matches the year of release (21 was released in 2021 for eg) for versioning.

MX offers releases supporting x86 32-bit PAE (i686-compatible) processors, x86 64-bit processors, and the Raspberry Pi's 32-bit armhf architecture.
