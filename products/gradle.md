> [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for
> multi-language development. If you are building, testing, publishing, and deploying software on
> any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that can support the entire development lifecycle
> from compiling and packaging code to publishing websites.

Gradle follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The 
[support and EOL policy](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/feature_lifecycle.html#eol_support) states that each major release causes:
- The previous major version becomes maintenance only (end of active support). It will only receive critical bug fixes and security fixes.
- The major version before the previous one to become end-of-life (EOL), and that release line will not receive any new fixes.

## [Java Compatibility](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html)

Gradle itself is tested with the following versions:

| Gradle                                                          | Java | Kotlin        | Groovy       | Android                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| [8](https://docs.gradle.org/8.0/userguide/compatibility.html)   | 8-19 | 1.6.10-1.8.10 | 1.5.8-4.0.0  | 7.3, 7.4, 8.0                     |
| [7](https://docs.gradle.org/7.6.2/userguide/compatibility.html) | 8-19 | 1.3.72-1.7.10 | 1.5.8-4.0.0  | 4.1, 4.2, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 |
| [6](https://docs.gradle.org/6.9.3/userguide/compatibility.html) | 8-15 | 1.3.21-1.4.20 | 1.5.8-2.5.12 | 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2      |

Java 6 and 7 can still be used for compilation and forked test execution.
