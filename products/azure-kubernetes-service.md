> [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/) is a managed service that
> you can use to run Kubernetes on Azure without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own
> Kubernetes control plane or nodes.

AKS defines a generally available version as a version enabled in all SLO or SLA measurements and
available in all regions. AKS supports three GA minor versions of Kubernetes:

- The latest GA minor version released in AKS.
- Two previous minor versions.

Each supported minor version also supports a maximum of two stable patches.

AKS release notes are available on [https://github.com/Azure/AKS/](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/).
News about AKS can be received by following [the AKS feed in Azure Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=kubernetes-service).
Release status by regions can be monitored at [AKS-Release-Tracker](https://releases.aks.azure.com/).
AKS Docs include an [Upgrade Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster).

Note that Calico isn't supported in AKS 1.25 and above.
