Akeneo PIM does not follow a documented release policy. But looking at the latest releases, it seems
that there is a new major release every year, with frequent patch versions containing bug fixes for
supported releases in between. All active releases, along with their EOL dates, are documented
[on their help center](https://help.akeneo.com/en_US/akeneo-pim/akeneo-pim-product-support-dates).
