> [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) is a widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as
> native cross-platform applications that supports Linux, Windows, macOS, Android and embedded
> systems. It is available under
> [both commercial licences and open-source](https://www.qt.io/licensing/ "Licensing page on the Qt Website")
> GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0, and LGPL 3.0 licenses.

Releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). There is a new minor release
[approximately every six months](https://wiki.qt.io/QtReleasing), which is supported with bug and
security fixes until the next minor release.

Some releases are designated as Long Term Support (LTS) releases. Those are supported for three
years but [only for commercial license holders](https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-offering-changes-2020).
For open source users, they are same as regular releases.

Extended support beyond EOL is available as a [commercial offering](https://www.qt.io/qt-support/)
from The Qt Company.

{: .warning }
> The [KDE Project](https://kde.org/) maintains a patch collection to support [Qt 5.15 LTS](https://community.kde.org/Qt5PatchCollection)
> for open-source users. Moreover, [the code of commercial releases is made open within 12 months](https://kde.org/community/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation/)
> and some level of security support still seems to continue [in the form of code patches](https://www.qt.io/blog/security-advisory-potential-integer-overflow-in-qts-http2-implementation).
> This does not reflect in the table above as we only track official releases from <https://www.qt.io>.
