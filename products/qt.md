> [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) is a widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as native cross-platform applications that supports Linux, Windows, macOS, Android and embedded systems. It is available under [both commercial licenses and open-source][license] GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0, and LGPL 3.0 licenses.

A regular release only receives patch releases during the first 6 months until the next feature release is out. An LTS release receives patch releases also after the next feature release is available. Regular releases are supported for one year.

- Starting from 5.15, LTS releases are supported for three years but [only for commercial license holders][lts-limit]. For open source users, they are same as regular releases.
- LTS releases before 5.15 are supported for three years.

The [KDE Project](https://kde.org/) maintains a patch collection to support [Qt 5.15 LTS](https://community.kde.org/Qt5PatchCollection) for open-source users. It is already packaged with [many linux distributions](https://repology.org/project/qt/badges), so you might already be covered. Extended support beyond LTS is available as a [commercial offering][extended-support] from The Qt Company.
