> [Veritas NetBackup Appliance OS](https://www.veritas.com/protection/netbackup) is an operating system designed by Veritas Technologies
> specifically for their NetBackup Appliance hardware.

{: .note }

The table above only documents the Primary phase because there is no new bug fixes in the Extended and Sustaining phases.

Veritas NetBackup Appliance OS support is split into three phases, each with different support levels and durations:
Primary, Extended, and Sustaining.

The Primary Phase begins with the general availability of a release and typically lasts for a period of 2 to 3 years.
During this phase releases are supported with bug fixes,
as well as patches for the software to establish or restore substantial conformity with the software’s documentation

The Extended Phase starts after the Primary Phase and lasts for 1 to 2 years.
During this phase no new bug fixes are provided, but customers can still access existing patches and receive technical support.

The Sustaining Phase follows the Extended Phase and can last from 1 to 6 years.
It is similar to the Extended Phase, but with a focus on on addressing severe service restoration or data retrieval issues.
