> [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) is a fork of Terraform that is open-source, community-driven, and managed by the Linux Foundation.

In their 2024-01-22 meeting, the OpenTofu Technical Steering Committee (TSC) [decided to adopt
the same support policy as Terraform](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/TSC_SUMMARY.md#2024-01-22-async):
patches for the most recent major release, as well as up to two prior ones. So up to three releases
will be supported at any given point in time.
