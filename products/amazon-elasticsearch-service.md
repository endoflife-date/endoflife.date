> This page tracks the AWS Managed Service. The Elasticsearch
> self-hosted offering is tracked at [Elasticsearch](/elasticsearch).

AWS provides bug fixes and security updates for versions under standard support. For versions in extended support, AWS offers critical security fixes for at least 12 months after standard support ends, at a flat fee per Normalized Instance Hour (NIH). NIH is based on instance size and usage hours.
