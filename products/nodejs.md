> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

Major Node.js versions enter Current release status for six months, which gives library authors time to add support for them. After six months, odd-numbered releases (9, 11, etc.) become unsupported, and even-numbered releases (10, 12, etc.) move to Active LTS status and are ready for general use. LTS release status is "long-term support", which typically guarantees that critical bugs will be fixed for a total of 30 months. Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases.

If a even-numbered release above is _not marked as LTS_, then it has not entered "Active LTS" and is not recommended for Production use.

The Active LTS start date is used as the release date for the table.
