> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment
> built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code outside a browser.

Major Node.js versions enter Current release status for six months, which gives library authors time
to add support for them. After six months, odd-numbered releases (9, 11, etc.) become unsupported,
and even-numbered releases (10, 12, etc.) move to Active LTS status and are ready for general use.
LTS release status is "long-term support", which typically guarantees that critical bugs will be
fixed for a total of 30 months. Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance
LTS releases.

If an even-numbered release above is _not marked as LTS_, then it has not entered "Active LTS" and
is not recommended for Production use.

The End-of-Life date for Node.js 16 was [moved forward by seven months](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/nodejs16-eol/ "Bringing forward the End-of-Life Date for Node.js 16")
to coincide with the end of support of OpenSSL 1.1.1 on September 11th, 2023.
