> [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats/) are a suite of lightweight shippers for Elasticsearch and
> Logstash. As of 2022, the beats family is composed of
> [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat),
> [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/metricbeat),
> [Packetbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat),
> [Winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/winlogbeat),
> [Auditbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/auditbeat),
> [Heartbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/heartbeat) and
> [Functionbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/functionbeat).

Beats are part of the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/), also known as the
[ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack). It shares the same support policy as the
other products in the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana...).

Elastic Stack product releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
Elastic provides maintenance for each major release series for the longest of 30 months after the GA date of the major release
or 18 months after the GA date of the following major release.
For example, if version 1.0 was released on 10-Apr-2019 and version 2.0 was released on 10-Feb-2022.

- 30 months from 1.0 GA date is 10-Oct-2021
- 18 months from 2.0 GA date is 10-Aug-2023
- 1.x maintenance would end on 10-Aug-2023

End-of-life dates for Beats can be found on the [Elastic product EOL dates page](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol).
Support for various operating systems can also be found on the [Elastic support matrix page](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix).
