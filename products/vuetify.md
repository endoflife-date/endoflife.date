> [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) is a no design skills required UI Library with 
> beautifully handcrafted Vue Components.

Each major release is supported with critical and security fixes for [a minimum of 18 months](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/introduction/long-term-support/) from the date of release of the last minor version in a given cycle, which marks the start of LTS.

We understand that many projects that utilize Vuetify have development cycles
that prevent upgrading to the latest version. In order to provide developers
and businesses peace of mind when adopting Vuetify, we commit to at minimu
of 18 months for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities for the latest minor of the last major release.
