> [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is a software library for applications that secure
> communications over computer networks against eavesdropping or need to identify the party at the
> other end. It is widely used by Internet servers, including the majority of HTTPS websites.

It is supported for [UNIX-like platforms](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-UNIX.md),
[Android](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-ANDROID.md),
[Windows](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-WINDOWS.md),
[DOS platform with DJGPP](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-DJGPP.md),
[OpenVMS](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-VMS.md),
[Perl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-PERL.md) and
[Valgrind](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-PERL.md).

LTS releases will be supported for at least five years, and they will specify one at least every
four years. Non-LTS releases will be supported for at least two years.

As of release 3.0.0, the OpenSSL versioning scheme is changing to a more contemporary format:
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. With this format, API/ABI compatibility will be guaranteed for the same `MAJOR`
version number. Previously they guaranteed API/ABI compatibility across the same `MAJOR.MINOR`
combination.

- `MAJOR`: API/ABI incompatible changes will increase this number
- `MINOR`: API/ABI compatible feature releases will change this
- `PATCH`: Bug fix releases will increment this number. We also allow backporting of accessor
  functions in these releases.

In addition to community support, the _OpenSSL Software Services_ provide commercial extended
support through the [Premium Enterprise Level Support contract](https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html#premium).
With this contract, LTS releases remain supported beyond the public EOL date for as long as it
remains commercially viable for OpenSSL Software Services.
