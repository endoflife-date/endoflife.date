releases:
-   releaseCycle: "2.6"
    releaseDate: 2023-02-07
    support: 2018-01-31

    # EOL date (mandatory).
    # This is where all support stops (including security support).
    # In case there is extended/commercial support available, pick the date that would apply to the
    # majority of users (and use the extendedSupport field if necessary).
    # Use valid dates, and do not add quotes around dates.
    # Alternatively, set to true|false the date has not been decided yet.
    eol: 2019-01-01

    # End of extended/commercial support date (optional if extendedSupportColumn is false, else mandatory).
    # Note that extended/commercial support is different from Long-Term Support. Extended/commercial
    # support must be used only when additional support is available after EOL, usually against payment.
    # Use valid dates, and do not add quotes around dates.
    # Alternatively, set to true|false if the date has not been decided yet.
    extendedSupport: 2020-01-01

    # Latest release for the release cycle (optional if releaseColumn is false, else mandatory).
    # Usually this is the release cycle's latest "patch" release.
    # It should be removed if releaseColumn is false.
    # Always add quotes around this value.
    latest: "1.2.3"

    # Latest release date (optional).
    # Use valid dates, and do not add quotes around dates.
    latestReleaseDate: 2022-01-23

    # Whether this is a "LTS" release (optional, default = false).
    # What LTS means may differ from product to product (see LTSLabel above).
    # Only provide for a release that will get much longer support than usual.
    lts: true

    # Whether this is a "discontinued" release (optional).
    # Can be set to true/false.
    # Only use if discontinuedColumn is set to true.
    discontinued: true

    # A link to the changelog for the latest release
    # (optional, default = the URL generated from changelogTemplate if it is provided).
    # Use this if the link is not predictable (i.e. you can't use changelogTemplate),
    # or if the changelogTemplate generated link must be overridden.
    # Do not use a localized URL (such as one containing en-us) if possible.
    # Use the special value 'null' (unquoted) if you want to disable link for a specific cycle of a
    # product having a changelogTemplate.
    link: https://example.com/news/2021-12-25/release-1.2.3

# In the following markdown section, ensure that all the above are present:
# 1. A one line statement about what the product is, with a link to the primary website (in a quote).
# 2. A short summary of the release policy, pointing out the EoL policy as well, if available.
# 3. Any additional information that may be of interest.
#
# See also the Guiding Principles on the wiki ( https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/wiki/Guiding-Principles )
# for indication on the tone and voice to use for the text.
