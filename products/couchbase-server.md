Security updates stop when a release reaches end of "Full Maintenance". Major versions are supported
for the longer period between:

1. 30 months from its General Availability Date
2. 6 months after the next Major Release version release.

Limited Support is also available after the end of Full Maintenance. But this is only best effort
support without any code fixes or security updates, so this page does not track it.
