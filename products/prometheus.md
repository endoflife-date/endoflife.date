## Release Cadence

Every 6 weeks, a new Prometheus minor release cycle begins. After those 6 weeks, minor releases
generally no longer receive bugfixes. If a user is impacted by a bug in a minor release, they often
need to upgrade to the latest Prometheus release.

Prometheus promises API stability within a major version, and strives to avoid breaking changes for
key features. Some features, which are cosmetic, still under development, or depend on 3rd party
services, are not covered by this.

## Long Term Support

Prometheus LTS releases only receive bug, security, and documentation fixes, but over a time window
of one year. The build toolchain is also be kept up-to-date. The following features are excluded
from [LTS Support](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/release-cycle/#limitations-of-lts-support):

- features listed as `unstable` in the [API stability guarantees](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/),
- experimental features,
- OpenBSD support.
