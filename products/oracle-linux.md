> [Oracle Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/) is an Open Source, free RHEL derivative developed
> by Oracle to be 100% application binary compatible alternative to Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## [Support Tiers](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/library/enterprise-linux-support-policies-069172.pdf)

- **Basic Support**: Available for 10 years for versions 5-9 from date of release. Includes access
  to patches, fixes, security patches and security alerts.
- **Premier Support**: Available for 10 years for versions 5-9 from date of release. Includes
  access to patches, fixes, security patches and security alerts. Additionally, includes live
  kernel patching (Certain security patches that may be applied without a reboot).
- **Extended Support**: Available for a limited time, after Premier Support ends, as per agreement
  with Oracle. Includes patches and fixes for critical security errata and select high-impact
  critical bug fixes. Updates are limited to select packages listed at <https://linux.oracle.com/es/packagelist.html>.
  Also includes live kernel patching.
- **Sustaining Support**: Available after Extended support ends. Does not include any new security
  fixes or alerts.

## Differences with Upstream RHEL:

- Unlike RHEL, [Oracle Linux does not support point releases once a newer one is available](https://community.oracle.com/tech/apps-infra/discussion/4481998/what-is-the-lifecycle-of-oracle-linux-for-minor-releases).
  Once a new minor point release is available, the older one is immediately considered end of life
  and users must upgrade to continue receiving security updates. For example once 8.5 gets a
  general release, 8.4 is immediately end of life. Whereas on RHEL [this is not the case.](https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-eus)
- Oracle Linux offers different support periods than upstream RHEL, with extra fees for using
  extended support which is explained [here](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/linux/oracle-linux-extended-support-ds.pdf).
- By default, Oracle Linux does not use the same kernel upstream RHEL uses, instead they support
  their own kernel builds called [UEK](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/uek/) which may
  not be compatible with upstream kernels. [There is a Red Hat Compatible Kernel (RHCK) available
  as an alternative](https://community.oracle.com/tech/apps-infra/discussion/4467791/oracle-linux-how-to-change-default-kernel).
