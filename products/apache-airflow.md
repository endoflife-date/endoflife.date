> [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is a platform to programmatically author, schedule
> and monitor workflows.

Apache Airflow follows semantic versioning for all packages. Specific rules by package types can
be found in <https://github.com/apache/airflow?tab=readme-ov-file#semantic-versioning>.

Apache Airflow follows a lifecycle with two distinct phases. The first one is the _Active support_
phase, which comes with new features as well as bug and security fixes. It is followed by the
_Limited support_ phase, which comes only with critical bug and security fixes. Dates for each
phase is documented on <https://github.com/apache/airflow#version-life-cycle>.

[Python and Kubernetes compatibility](https://github.com/apache/airflow#support-for-python-and-kubernetes-versions)
is usually maintained until EOL of upstream provider versions.
