> [VMware vCenter Server](https://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-server.html) is an advanced server management software that provides a centralized platform for controlling vSphere environments for visibility across hybrid clouds.

VMware typically support vCenter for a duration of 7 years with 5 years of general support and an additional 2 years of technical guidance during which vCenter will no longer receive bug fixes and security updates. Additional information on lifecycle phases can be found at <https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/enterprise-infrastructure.html>.

## [Product Lifecycle](https://lifecycle.vmware.com/)

**General Support**: The last date on which you can request support; the end of regular VMware maintenance updates and upgrades, _bug and security fixes,_ and technical assistance as per the Support and Subscription Terms and Conditions.

**Technical Guidance**: The last date on which you can access support and workarounds for low-severity issues on supported configurations only. During the Technical Guidance phase, VMware does not offer new hardware support, server/client/guest OS updates, new security patches or bug fixes unless otherwise noted.
