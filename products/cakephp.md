> [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/) is a free and open source PHP web development framework. It
> follows the model–view–controller (MVC) approach and is written in PHP, modeled after the concepts
> of Ruby on Rails.

CakePHP follows [Semantic Versioning](https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/release-policy.html). From 3.x
onward, major versions have a name:

| Version | Name       |
|---------|------------|
| 5.x     | Chiffon    |
| 4.x     | Strawberry |
| 3.x     | Red Velvet |

Support and EOL policy for 1.x [was not clearly defined](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20162089/cakephp-1-x-end-of-support-date).
2.x and 3.x support and EOL policies are documented on <https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/wiki>.
From 3.x onward, [it seems](https://bakery.cakephp.org/2023/01/01/cakephp_3_end_of_life_3105_released.html)
only the last major release will be actively developed, and older major releases will receive
bugfixes for 24 months and security fixes for 36 months.

Minor releases also do hold significance for the CakePHP project: the last three minor versions of
the last major release cycle have security support.

## PHP Support

Version    | Min PHP | Max PHP
-----------|---------|--------
5.0        | 8.1     | Latest
4.4        | 7.4     | Latest
4.0 - 4.3  | 7.2     |
3.4 - 3.10 | 5.6     | 7.4
3.2 - 3.3  | 5.5     |
3.0 - 3.1  | 5.4     |
2          | 5.4     | 7.4
