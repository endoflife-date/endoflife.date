> [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell
> and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC)
> architectural pattern and based on Symfony.

{: .warning }
> This page is tracking the [Laravel framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework), not the
> [Laravel application](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) which is just the starter application.

For LTS releases, such as Laravel 5.5 and 6.0, bug fixes are provided for 2 years and security fixes
are provided for 3 years. These releases provide the longest window of support and maintenance. For
general releases, bug fixes are provided for 6 months and security fixes are provided for 1 year.
For all additional libraries, including Lumen, only the latest release receives bug fixes.
