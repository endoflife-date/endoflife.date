# This regex drops '.0' from versions because x.y.0 releases are always referred as x.y.
# The patch part is like that to handle properly tiny versions, such as 1.5.1.3, are handled properly.
# But note that this regex would not work if WordPress releases an x.y.0.t version.
# That should not be a problem though, such version were only used with 1.5.1.
# See https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/pull/2768#issuecomment-1491875624.
