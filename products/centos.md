> [CentOS Linux](https://centos.org/centos-linux/) was a Linux distribution that provided a free,
> enterprise-class, community-supported computing platform functionally compatible with Red Hat
> Enterprise Linux.

CentOS Linux was a rebuild of [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](/rhel) source code. Major versions
were supported with security and bugfix updates as long as its corresponding RHEL release was not EOL,
except for CentOS Linux 8.

[It was announced on December 8th, 2020](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/)
that work on CentOS Linux 8 would cease at the end of 2021 and that focus would shift to CentOS Stream.
Support information for CentOS Stream is available on the [CentOS Stream page](/centos-stream).

Commercial long term support for CentOS 6, 7, and 8 post end-of-life is available at [OpenLogic by Perforce](https://www.openlogic.com/solutions/enterprise-linux-support/centos).
