> [CentOS Linux](https://centos.org/centos-linux/) was a Linux distribution that provided a free,
> enterprise-class, community-supported computing platform functionally compatible with
> [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](/rhel).

{: .warning }
> CentOS Linux has been discontinued and is **not safe to use anymore**. Read the [information on
> upgrade and migration options](https://blog.centos.org/2023/04/end-dates-are-coming-for-centos-stream-8-and-centos-linux-7/).

Work on [CentOS Linux 8 ceased at the end of 2021](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/)
as Red Hat shifted focus to [CentOS Stream](/centos-stream).

Commercial long term support for CentOS 6, 7, and 8 post end-of-life is available at [OpenLogic by
Perforce](https://www.openlogic.com/solutions/enterprise-linux-support/centos).
