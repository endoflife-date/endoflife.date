> [CentOS Linux](https://centos.org/centos-linux/) is a Linux distribution that provides a free,
> enterprise-class, community-supported computing platform functionally compatible with Red Hat
> Enterprise Linux.

CentOS Linux is a rebuild of [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](/rhel) source code. Major versions
are supported with security and bugfix updates as long as its corresponding RHEL release is not EOL,
except for CentOS Linux 8.

[It was announced on December 8th, 2020](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/)
that work on CentOS Linux 8 will cease at the end of 2021 and that shift will focus to CentOS Stream.
Support information for CentOS Stream are available on the [CentOS Stream page](/centos-stream).
