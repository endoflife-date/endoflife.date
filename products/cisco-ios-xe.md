> Cisco IOS XE is a network operating system that is based on the Linux kernel.
> It is used on a variety of Cisco products, including routers, switches, and wireless controllers.

Releases are time-based, each with a fixed release date. The schedule specifies 3 minor releases per year at 4 month intervals.
Every subsequent first and second release (e.g. 17.1, 17.2, 17.4, 17.5...) receive standard support.
Every subsequent third release (e.g. 17.3, 17.6...) receive extended support.

Standard-Support means, that the release has a sustaining support lifetime of 12 months from First Customer Shipment (FCS) with scheduled rebuilds.
Extended-Support means, that the release has a sustaining support lifetime of 48 months from First Customer Shipment (FCS) with scheduled rebuilds.
