> [VMware Horizon](https://www.vmware.com/products/horizon.html) enables a digital workspace with the efficient delivery of virtual desktops and applications that equips workers anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

[Starting in Q2 2018,](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/52845) Horizon introduced an option of Extended Service Branch (ESB) in addition to the Current Release (CR) branch.  ESBs receive three planned periodic maintenance updates – typically 6 months, 9 months and 15 months after the base version release.
