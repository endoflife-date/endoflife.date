[Starting in Q2 2018,](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/52845) Horizon introduced an option of Extended Service Branch (ESB) in addition to the Current Release (CR) branch.  ESBs receive three planned periodic maintenance updates â€“ typically 6 months, 9 months and 15 months after the base version release.

upgrades, _bug and security fixes,_ and technical assistance as per the Support and Subscription

configurations only. During the Technical Guidance phase, VMware does not offer new hardware
support, server/client/guest OS updates, new security patches or bug fixes unless otherwise noted.
