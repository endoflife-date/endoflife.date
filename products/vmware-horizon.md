> [VMware Horizon](https://www.vmware.com/products/horizon.html) enables a digital workspace with the efficient delivery of virtual desktops and applications that equips workers anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

[Starting in Q2 2018,](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/52845) Horizon introduced an option of Extended Service Branch (ESB) in addition to the Current Release (CR) branch.  ESBs receive three planned periodic maintenance updates – typically 6 months, 9 months and 15 months after the base version release.

## [Product Lifecycle](https://lifecycle.vmware.com/)

**General Support**: The last date on which you can request support; the end of regular VMware maintenance updates and upgrades, _bug and security fixes,_ and technical assistance as per the Support and Subscription Terms and Conditions.

**Technical Guidance**: The last date on which you can access support and workarounds for low-severity issues on supported configurations only. During the Technical Guidance phase, VMware does not offer new hardware support, server/client/guest OS updates, new security patches or bug fixes unless otherwise noted.
