> [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) is a code search and intelligence tool for developers that helps
> them find, understand, and fix code across all of their projects and dependencies.

Sourcegraph is available in self-hosted and cloud editions. This page only tracks releases for
the self-hosted offering. While limited support is offered for the previous major version, it does
not include bug-fixes or security backports. Consequentially, this page marks all but the latest
release as unsupported.

Sourcegraph provides [enterprise support](https://sourcegraph.com/pricing) with additional features
and support for organizations.
