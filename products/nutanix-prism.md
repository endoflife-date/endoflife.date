> [Nutanix Prism](https://www.nutanix.com/uk/products/prism) is the control plane that simplifies
> and streamlines common workflows to make hypervisor and VM setup as easy as checking your email.

Only the latest patch release in a release cycle is supported.

Each release cycle (Upgrade) is maintained (with workarounds, bug fixes) for 2 months from the
release date of the next release cycle. It then further receives Troubleshooting (phone support,
security fixes) for another 3 months.

For example, if Nutanix releases PC.2020.8 on Aug 1, 2020 and releases PC.2020.9 on Sep 1, 2020 then
PC.2020.8 will be Maintained until Nov 30, 2020 and Troubleshooting for PC.2020.8 will be available
until Feb 28, 2021.

## Release Cadence

* A new major/minor release is typically made every 4-6 weeks.
* Patch releases are made available on an as-needed basis.
