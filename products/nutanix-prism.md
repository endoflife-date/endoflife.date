> [Nutanix Prism](https://www.nutanix.com/uk/products/prism) is the control plane
> that simplifies and streamlines common workflows to make hypervisor and VM setup as easy as checking your email.

Nutanix Prism versions are designated using the following format: `pc.X.Y.Z.n`,
where `X` is the major version, `Y` is the minor version, `Z` is the maintenance version, and `n` is the patch version.

Since Prism pc.2024.3, Nutanix [transitioned](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/kbs/details?targetId=kA00e000000LIi9CAG)
from the LTS/STS/eSTS release model to a Unified 'NCI Release Model'.
Under this model, major or minor releases are typically made available every 6â€“9 months.
All releases are actively maintained with bug and security fixes for 15 months,
followed by an additional 9 months of troubleshooting with only security fixes.
