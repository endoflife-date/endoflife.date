> [Trend Micro Deep Security](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/deep-security.html)
> provides advanced server security for physical, virtual, and cloud servers.

Deep Security [release strategy](https://help.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/20_0/on-premise/release-lifecycle.html) used to include both Long-Term Support (LTS) and Feature Releases (FR). After the release of Deep Security 20, the Feature Releases are no longer released to reduce the number of software upgrades and simplify the support policy.
