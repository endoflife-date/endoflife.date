> [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/) (formerly Amazon
> Elasticsearch Service) is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale
> OpenSearch clusters in the AWS Cloud.

Extended Support charges apply automatically when a domain runs a version for which standard
support has ended. To avoid charges, upgrade to a version still under standard support. See
[Standard and extended support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/what-is.html#choosing-version)
for details.
