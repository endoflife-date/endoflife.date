> [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/) (formerly Amazon
> Elasticsearch Service) is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale
> OpenSearch clusters in the AWS Cloud.

Amazon OpenSearch Service supports two search engine families: **OpenSearch** (versions 1.x–3.x)
and legacy **Elasticsearch OSS** (versions 1.5–7.10, the final open-source Elasticsearch release).
Release cycles in this page are prefixed with `os-` for OpenSearch and `es-` for Elasticsearch.

Extended Support charges apply automatically when a domain runs a version for which standard
support has ended. To avoid charges, upgrade to a version still under standard support. See
[Standard and extended support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/what-is.html#choosing-version)
for details.

Note: Elasticsearch 5.6 has an extended support window until November 7, 2028 (vs. November 7,
2026 for most other versions).
