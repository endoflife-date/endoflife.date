> [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a modern package manager for the Javascript ecosystem. It offers
> extensibility via plugins, and a Plug and Play strategy that supports various frameworks and tools.

Yarn's support and EOL policy is not clearly defined.

Yarn Classic (v1) [entered maintenance mode in January 2020](https://dev.to/arcanis/introducing-yarn-2-4eh1#what-will-happen-to-the-legacy-codebase)
and will eventually reach end-of-life. It is highly recommended to
[Migrate](https://yarnpkg.com/migration/overview) to the latest version. Yarn
Classic only receives critical and security fixes.
