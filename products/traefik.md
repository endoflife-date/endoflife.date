> [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) is a leading modern reverse proxy and load balancer that
> makes deploying microservices easy.

## [Versioning Scheme](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/deprecation/releases/#versioning-scheme)

The Traefik Proxy project follows the **semantic versioning** scheme and maintains a separate
branch for each minor version. The main branch always represents the next upcoming minor or major
version.

And these are our guiding rules for version support:

- **Only the latest `minor`** will be on active support at any given time
- **The last `minor` after releasing a new `major`** will be supported for 1 year following the
  major release
- **Previous rules are subject to change** and in such cases an announcement will be made publicly,
  [here](https://traefik.io/blog/traefik-2-1-in-the-wild/) is an example extending `v1.x` branch
  support.
