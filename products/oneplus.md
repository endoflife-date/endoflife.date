###### Supported Android versions ######
# Because OnePlus is using community forum posts as official releases posts it is hard to parse the last Android/OxygenOS releases 
# for all devices so I'm using the unofficial https://oxygenupdater.com/news/all/ that have been collecting all OnePlus OxygenOS announcements for several years and is an established and trusted way to get OP updates.
# still not great but easier to search and parse than OnePlus Community and more up to date than GsmArena
# There is also https://www.androidupdatetracker.com/policy/oneplus that is easier to parse, have good links to announcements but AFAIK is less established, and has one error in update policy regarding the Nord N series.
