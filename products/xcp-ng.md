> [XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org) is a free and open-source hypervisor based on
> [Xen](https://xenproject.org/). It is a fork of [XenServer](https://xenserver.com/), which was
> acquired by Citrix in 2013. It is a drop-in replacement for XenServer, and can be used to manage
> and run virtual machines on any hardware that supports the Xen hypervisor. XCP-ng is developed by
> a community of contributors and is available for free.

There are two kinds of XCP-ng releases: standard releases and Long Term Support (LTS) releases.
Standard releases are supported until the next release, plus a few months to give the users some
time to transition. LTS releases are supported for 5 years.
