> [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) is a strong statically typed general-purpose programming
> language that supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming. Designed to be
> concise, many of Scala's design decisions are aimed to address criticisms of Java.

Only the latest `2.x` and `3.x` releases are actively developed. Those versions are named _current
releases_.

A few older `2.x` releases are also maintained with bug fixes and security support. Those releases
are named _maintenance releases_ and are maintained for a long time (because migration between two
`2.x` releases is difficult).

## Scala 3 future release policy

[The release policy of Scala 3 is about to change](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2022/08/17/long-term-compatibility-plans.html "Long-term compatibility plans for Scala 3").
Starting with Scala 3.3, development will be split into two lines called _Scala Next_ (for newest
and experimental features) and _Scala LTS_ (only bug fixes, non-language changes and minor
quality-of-life enhancements). LTS releases will be released every two years and each LTS
release will be supported for at least three years.

## [JDK Compatibility](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/jdk-compatibility/overview.html)

Scalaâ€™s primary platform is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

| JDK version | Minimum Scala versions         |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| 21 (ea)     | 3.3.1, 2.13.11, 2.12.18        |
| 20          | 3.3.0, 2.13.11, 2.12.18        |
| 19          | 3.2.0, 2.13.9, 2.12.16         |
| 18          | 3.1.3, 2.13.7, 2.12.15         |
| 17 (LTS)    | 3.0.0, 2.13.6, 2.12.15         |
| 11 (LTS)    | 3.0.0, 2.13.0, 2.12.4, 2.11.12 |
| 8 (LTS)     | 3.0.0, 2.13.0, 2.12.0, 2.11.0  |

Using the latest patch version is always recommended.
