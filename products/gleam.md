> [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) is a programming language for building type-safe, scalable systems. It runs on the [Erlang](/erlang) VM and is part of the BEAM ecosystem.

Gleam does not have a clear release, support and EOL policy.
Looking at the latest releases, it seems that only the latest release is supported.
