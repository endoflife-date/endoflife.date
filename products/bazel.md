> [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) is a fast, scalable, multi-language and extensible build system.

Bazel follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

- A major release contains features that are not backward compatible with the previous release. Each major Bazel version is an LTS release.
- A minor release contains backward-compatible bug fixes and features back-ported from the main branch.
- A patch release contains critical bug fixes.
