> [CentOS Stream](https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/) is a continuously delivered Linux
> distribution that tracks just ahead of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) development, positioned as
> a midstream between Fedora Linux and RHEL.

CentOS Stream is the upstream variant of [CentOS](/centos) and contains content that is planned for
the next minor release of [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](/rhel).

CentOS Stream only has major versions, and its support ends when its [corresponding RHEL release](/rhel)
leaves full support.

Support information for CentOS are available on the [CentOS page](/centos).
