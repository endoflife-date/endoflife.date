> [CentOS](https://centos.org/) is a Linux distribution that provides a free, enterprise-class,
> community-supported computing platform functionally compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

CentOS Stream is the upstream variant, and contains content that is planned for the next minor
release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

CentOS Stream only has major versions, no minor versions. Its support ends when its corresponding
RHEL release leaves full support.
