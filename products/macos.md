>[macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) (aka OS X, Mac OS X) is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers.

Major versions of macOS are released once a year now, and usually maintained for three years. Apple usually provides security updates for the latest 3 releases, but this isn't consistenly applied and some security fixes aren't available for the non-latest releases.
