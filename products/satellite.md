> [Red Hat Satellite](https://www.redhat.com/technologies/management/satellite) is an infrastructure management product specifically designed to keep Red Hat Enterprise LinuxÂ® environments and other Red Hat infrastructure running efficiently, with security, and compliant with various standards.

Red Hat Satellite is usually released 6 months. The current version is usually supported for additional 12 months once a successor was published. The upstream open-source projects are [Foreman](https://theforeman.org/) and [Katello](https://theforeman.org/plugins/katello/) - they share the most functionality, but come without paid support.
