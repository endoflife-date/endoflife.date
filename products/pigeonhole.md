> [Pigeonhole](https://pigeonhole.dovecot.org/) is the project that adds support for the Sieve
> language and the ManageSieve protocol to the [Dovecot](https://dovecot.org/) Secure IMAP Server.

Pigeonhole does not follow a documented release policy for its own. It follows the same cycle as
[Dovecot](/dovecot) does, even if that means to do a release without changes to keep version numbers
synced.  
Since v2.4.0 (released in 2025) the version numbering scheme is also aligned to match Dovecot's
scheme.
