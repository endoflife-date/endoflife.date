> [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tls/about/) is a cryptographic protocol
> designed to provide communications security over a computer network, such as the Internet.
> The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP,
> but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible.

TLS is a proposed [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://www.ietf.org/) standard.
New releases and deprecations are announced using [RFCs](https://www.rfc-editor.org/).
