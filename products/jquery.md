Only the latest version in the current release cycle is supported. The 1.x and 2.x branches no
longer receive patches, although a core team lead [stated that](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/5322#issuecomment-1719939675)
serious security patches have been backported and that they would consider it again in the future.
