> Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other
> open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and
> tablets.

Major versions of Android are released once a year now, prior to the launch of their Pixel phones.
See [Android OS Version History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history) as well.

A stripped-down version of the Android operating system designed for low-end and ultra-budget
smartphones, [Android (Go edition)](https://www.android.com/versions/go-edition/), is also
made available by Google since Android 8.1. While based on Android it seems to follow a distinct
release and EOL policy.
