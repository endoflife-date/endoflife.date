>Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

Major versions of Android are released once a year now, prior to the launch of their Pixel phones. See [Android OS Version History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history) as well.
