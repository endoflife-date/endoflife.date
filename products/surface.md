> Microsoft Surface is a series of touchscreen-based personal computers and interactive whiteboards
> designed and developed by Microsoft, running the Microsoft Windows operating system.

Microsoft defines a supported Surface Device as one receiving driver and firmware updates, along
with a supported Windows OS version. Surface devices will receive driver and firmware updates for
Windows versions released in the prior 30 months.

Microsoft publishes the [minimum supported Windows version](https://support.microsoft.com/surface/surface-supported-operating-systems-9559cc3c-7a38-31b6-d9fb-571435e84cd1).
Once the device support period is concluded, devices will continue to receive Windows OS feature and
security updates.
