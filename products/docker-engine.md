> [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/) is a containerisation technology that allows applications
> to be packaged independently, avoiding the requirement to install or manage software dependencies.
> Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and
> configuration files.

Docker Engine is supported by the [Moby Community](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#support),
and as such - there's no list of supported releases.
This page uses the [Open milestones](https://github.com/moby/moby/milestones) as a guide for which releases
are still getting fixes.

Mirantis [has promised](https://github.com/moby/moby/discussions/45104#discussioncomment-6013686)
to backport security fixes and fixes for bugs which impact their customers to the 20.10 branch until
Mirantis Container Runtime 20.10 reaches end-of-life on 2023 December 10. Microsoft is also
committed to maintaining the 20.10 branch in public for now.
