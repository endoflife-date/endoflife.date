Wforce does not follow a documented release policy.
Looking at the latest releases, it seems that:

- there is a new minor release every year
- there are patch versions for the latest release cycle as needed
- each new release cycle ends the previous one
- public/stable cycles do have an even minor number

Wforce is a project by Dovecot, PowerDNS and Open-Xchange. For historical reasons, it lives in the
PowerDNS GitHub organization. Usage of wforce is not bound to any of those tools.
