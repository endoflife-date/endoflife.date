> [Contour](https://projectcontour.io/) is an ingress controller for Kubernetes that works by deploying [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Contour supports dynamic configuration updates out of the box while maintaining a lightweight profile.

Contour follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). A new minor version is released approximately once a quarter.

The latest three releases are supported with critical and security fixes.

A [compatibility matrix](https://projectcontour.io/resources/compatibility-matrix/) is published
for compatibility with the Envoy/Kubernetes versions supported for every release.
