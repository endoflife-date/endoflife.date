> [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) is an open source content management system built on Django, with a strong community and commercial support. It's focused on user experience, and offers precise control for designers and developers.

Minor/Feature releases of Wagtail are released every three months. A feature release will usually stop receiving patch release updates when the next feature release comes out. LTS releases receive fixes for security and data-loss related issues. Typically, an LTS release will happen once every four feature releases and receive updates for five feature releases, giving a support period of fifteen months with a three month overlap. LTS releases will ensure compatibility with at least one [Django LTS release][django-lts].

The Wagtail team provides [official security support](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/contributing/security.html#supported-versions) for:

* The two most recent Wagtail release series. (Currently `2.13` and `2.12`)
* The latest LTS release.

*[LTS]: Long Term Support
