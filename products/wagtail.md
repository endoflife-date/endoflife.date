> [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/) is an open source content management system built on Django, with
> a strong community and commercial support. It's focused on user experience, and offers precise
> control for designers and developers.

Minor/Feature releases of Wagtail are released every three months. A feature release will usually
stop receiving patch release updates when the next feature release comes out. LTS releases receive
fixes for security and data-loss related issues. Typically, an LTS release will happen once every
four feature releases and receive updates for five feature releases, giving a support period of
fifteen months with a three-month overlap. LTS releases will ensure compatibility with at least
one [Django LTS release](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions).

The Wagtail team provides [official security support](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/contributing/security.html#supported-versions) for:

* The two most recent Wagtail release series.
* The latest LTS release.
