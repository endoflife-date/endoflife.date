# The policy before 9.0 release was to support 2 major versions. After 9.0, 2 latest minors are
# supported, along with the last minor of the previous major. Hence, we break the latest series into
# minors but only keep the previous major.

## Support Policy

{: .warning }
> Grafana Cloud, the hosted offering from Grafana Labs, has separate [support options](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/account-management/support/).

- Only latest version sees active development.
- The previous minor version, and the last minor version of the previous major version gets security
  and critical bug fixes.

## [Release Schedule](https://grafana.com/blog/2022/12/13/grafana-releases-new-2023-release-schedule/)

- On even-numbered months (February, April, etc.) a minor version is released with new
  features, bug fixes, and security updates.
- On odd-numbered months (March, May, etc.) patch releases are made, which will only include bug
  fixes and security updates.

Release builds are cut a week in advance, to validate and prepare for each release internally.
