> [Jira Software](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is a proprietary issue tracking product
> developed by Atlassian that allows bug tracking and agile project management.

Jira Software is available both as SaaS and on-premises offer, with three editions:

- Jira Software Cloud: Cloud edition, available through [Atlassian Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/cloud).
- Jira Software Server: Self-hosted edition.
- Jira Software Data Center: Self-hosted edition, targeted to enterprises (see [Jira
  Server and Data Center feature comparison](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/jira-server-and-data-center-feature-comparison-953651628.html)
  for more information).

This page is **only** about Jira Software Server and Jira Software Data Center. Jira Software Cloud
is a part of the Atlassian Cloud with [its own release cadence](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog).

Jira Software has both LTS and non-LTS releases. There is approximately one LTS release per year,
which receive security support and bug fixes for 2 years. Non-LTS releases are supported for
6 months (there may be some exception). More information can be found in
[this article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/enterprise/introducing-enterprise-releases).

Atlassian will end support for Jira Software Server [on February 15, 2024](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/journey-to-cloud),
but Jira Software Data Center will still be available.
