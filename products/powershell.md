> [PowerShell](https://aka.ms/powershell)  is a cross-platform automation and configuration tool/framework that is optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models. It includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language and a framework for processing cmdlets.

PowerShell follows the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/PowerShell-Support-Lifecycle).
