> [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is an analytical in-process, serverless SQL database management system.

Starting with 1.4, every other DuckDB version is a Long Term Support (LTS) release.
LTS releases are supported for one year.
Non-LTS releases become end-of-life once a newer release (LTS or not) is available.

[Commercial support by DuckDB Labs](https://duckdblabs.com/) is also available for older LTS releases after their community support has expired.
