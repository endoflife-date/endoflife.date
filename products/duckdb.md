> [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is an analytical in-process, serverless SQL database management system.

Starting with `v1.4.0`, every other DuckDB version is going to be a Long Term Support (LTS) edition.
For LTS DuckDB versions, community support will last a year after the release (for now). DuckDB Labs is also starting
to offer support for older LTS versions after their community support has expired.
