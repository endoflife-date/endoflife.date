> [Suse Linux Enterprise Server](https://www.suse.com/products/server/) is a modular linux
> distribution for both multimodal and traditional IT.

SLES has a thirteen-year product lifecycle. The current support model consists of 10 years of
general support, followed by 3 years of Long Term Service Pack Support (LTSS). Major versions are
released at an interval of 3â€“4 years, while minor versions (called "Service Packs") are released
about every 12 months. SLES receives more intense testing than the upstream openSUSE community
product.

SLES 13 and SLES 14 version numbers were skipped. Advisories are published at <https://www.suse.com/support/update/>.
