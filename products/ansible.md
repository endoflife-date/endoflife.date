> [Ansible](https://ansible.com) is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows.

The Ansible community package (which this page tracks) typically gets 2 major releases every year. A new minor version is released every 3 weeks. Maintenance fixes are guaranteed for only the latest major release. `ansible-core`, the package meant for developers, has [a separate maintenance policy](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#id14).

See the [Ansible Roadmap][roadmap] for upcoming release details.
