> [Nutanix Files](https://www.nutanix.com/uk/products/files) is a simple, scalable and smart cloud-based file management platform.

Only the latest release cycle is actively maintained (new features).

* A release is supported (with workarounds and bug fixes) for 3 months after a new major/minor version is released.
* Troubleshooting (security fixes, phone support) is provided for 12 months after a new major/minor version is released.

For example, if Nutanix releases Files 3.1.0 on September 1, 2018 and Files 3.2.0 on November 1, 2018 then Files 3.1.0 will be Maintained until February 28, 2019 and Troubleshooting for Files 3.1.0 will be available until November 30, 2019.

## Release Cadence

* A new major/minor release is typically made every 3-6 months.
* Maintenance releases are typically made every 4-6 weeks.
* Patch releases are made on an as-needed basis.
