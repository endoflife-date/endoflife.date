> [Eclipse Jetty](https://jetty.org/) is an open-source (Apache-2.0 licensed) pure-Java
> HTTP web server environment. It implements various [Jakarta web specifications](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-platform),
> including [JSP](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jsp "Jakarta Server Pages"),
> [Servlets](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.servlet "Jakarta Servlet"),
> and [WebSockets](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.websocket "Jakarta WebSocket").

Jetty does not have a fixed release and support policy. But a list of all versions, along with
their support status, is available [on Jetty website](https://jetty.org/download.html).

Support for Jetty is divided into two phases. The first phase, called _Community Support_,
comes with bug and security fixes. Once a release reach its End of Community Support (EoCS), Jetty
enters the second phase of support with only security and critical issues fixes until the full End
of Life (EOL).

Jetty is compatible with the following Java versions and specifications:
{% include table.html
labels="Release,Min. JVM,Servlet,JSP"
fields="releaseCycle,minJvmVersion,servletVersion,jspVersion"
types="string,string,string,string"
rows=page.releases %}

Commercial extended support by the developers of Jetty is available through [Webtide Lifecycle
Support](https://webtide.com/).
