> platform that provides cloud service providers with the capability to build secure, multi-tenant cloud 
> environments that provide organizations with a powerful self-service cloud platform.

VMware typically supports Cloud Director for a duration of 7 years with 5 years of general support and an
additional 2 years of technical guidance during which Cloud Director will no longer receive bug fixes and
security updates. Additional information on lifecycle phases can be found at
