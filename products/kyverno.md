> Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. Kyverno allows cluster administrators to manage environment
> specific configurations independently of workload configurations and enforce configuration best
> practices for their clusters.

Kyverno uses the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme. It follows the same support policy as Kubernetes - the
3 most recent minor versions receive security and bug fixes.
