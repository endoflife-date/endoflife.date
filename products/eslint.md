> [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a popular static code analysis tool used to identify problematic patterns found in
> JavaScript code. It is highly configurable and supports a wide range of plugins that extend its basic functionality,
> allowing developers to write cleaner, more consistent code aligned with their standards.

ESLint only actively supports the latest version with new features, bug fixes, and security updates. When a new major
version is released, the previous major version enters in a maintenance phase and only receives critical bug and
security fixes for 6 months.

Commercial support is available for both current and previous versions through ESLint's partners, [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/funding/github/npm/eslint)
and [HeroDevs](https://www.herodevs.com/support/eslint-nes).
