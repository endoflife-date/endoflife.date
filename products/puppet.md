> [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/) Puppet is a tool that helps you manage and automate the configuration of servers. Its primary product, Puppet Enterprise is a proprietary and closed-source version of its open-source Puppet software.

This page tracks the Open Source Puppet (OSP), and not Puppet Enterprise (PE). Version numbers are for puppet-agent, and corresponding version numbers of other components are published [on the platform lifecycle documentation](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/platform_lifecycle.html#component-version-numbers).

Puppet OSP has an Update Track: Puppet versions that are not associated with any PE version get updated minor (or "y") releases about once a month.
Releases in this track include fixes and new features, but typically do not get patch (or "z") releases. Developmental releases ('latest') are superseded by new versions about once a month.
Open source releases that are associated with PE versions have projected End of Life (EOL) dates.
