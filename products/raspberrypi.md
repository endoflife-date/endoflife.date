> [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs)
> developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It is widely used because of its low cost, modularity,
> and open design.

Some of Raspberry Pi hardware comes with an Obsolescence statement guaranteeing production till a
specific date. [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) supports
all Raspberry Pi models (excluding Pico).
