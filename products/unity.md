> [Unity](https://unity.com/) is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) games, as well as interactive simulations and other experiences.

Unity has two releases: Tech stream and LTS.

*Tech stream* releases are released twice a year (each one receiving weekly updates), and are supported only until the next tech stream release is out.

*Unity LTS releases* are released once a year and are based off the previous tech stream branch. LTS releases offer two years of bi-weekly updates, then an additional year of monthly updates.

Officially supported platforms as of Unity 2020 LTS are:

- Mobile: iOS, Android (Android TV), tvOS
- Desktop: Windows (Universal Windows Platform), Mac, Linux
- Web: WebGL
- Consoles: PlayStation (PS4, PS5), Xbox (Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S), Nintendo Switch, Stadia
- Virtual/Extended reality: Oculus, PlayStation VR, Google's ARCore, Apple's ARKit, Windows Mixed Reality (HoloLens), Magic Leap, and via Unity XR SDK Steam VR, Google Cardboard.
