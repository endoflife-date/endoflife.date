> [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the
> entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and
> motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline.

[Since February 2023](https://code.blender.org/2023/02/blender-release-cycle-update/#new-release-schedule),
Blender follows a 3-releases-per-year schedule, with one of the releases offering long-term support (Blender LTS).

Non-LTS releases are supported until the next release with high-priority bug fixes. High-severity and normal bugs
may be fixed too if agreed on by the team.

LTS releases are supported for 2 years. At first the support level is the same as non-LTS releases; but after the next
release is out, they are supported with critical bugfixes only.
