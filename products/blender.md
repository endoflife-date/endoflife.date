> [Blender](https://blender.org/) is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline.

With the release of Blender 2.83, Blender Foundation will start a LTS (Long Term Support) pilot program. The program is aimed at ensuring that long-lasting projects can be executed using a stable Blender version, which will provide critical fixes throughout a 2-year time span. 

Currently, for non-LTS releases, Blender only has a corrective release if severity 1 issues (high priority bugs) are found. When the corrective release is agreed on, however, severity 2 (high priority and normal bugs) fixes are ported along.

For the LTS releases, a more limited policy would apply (only porting severity 1 issues after the next stable release), on a fixed schedule (e.g., every 3 months) after the fix was tested in master for some time (e.g., 1 week). For more information on how this process works see the [related wiki.](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Process/LTS)
