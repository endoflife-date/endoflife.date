> [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the
> entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and
> motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline.

## [Long Term Support](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Process/LTS)

LTS releases are supported for 2 years with critical bug-fixes.

For non-LTS releases, Blender only has a corrective release if severity 1 issues (high
priority bugs) are found. When the corrective release is agreed on, however, severity 2 (high
priority and normal bugs) fixes are ported along.

For LTS releases, a more limited policy applies. Only severity 1 issues are ported (after the
next stable release), on a fixed schedule (e.g., every 3 months) after the fix was tested in master
for some time (e.g., 1 week).

## [Release Schedule](https://code.blender.org/2023/02/blender-release-cycle-update/#new-release-schedule)

An updated release schedule was proposed in [February 2023](https://code.blender.org/2023/02/blender-release-cycle-update/#new-release-schedule),
with the following goals:

- A new LTS release every year around June, supported for two years,
- A major version and breaking release every 2 years (3.0, 4.0, 5.0…).
