> SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, 
> transactional SQL database engine.

> The code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free for use for any purpose, commercial or private

## Long Term Support

_"The intent of the developers is to support SQLite through the year 2050."_

> In addition to "supporting" SQLite through the year 2050, the developers also promise to keep
> the SQLite [`C-language API`](https://www.sqlite.org/cintro.html) and [`on-disk format`](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html)
> fully backwards compatible.
> This means that application written to use SQLite today should be able to link against and
> use future versions of SQLite released decades in the future.

See [Long Term Support official and dedicated page](https://www.sqlite.org/lts.html) for more.
