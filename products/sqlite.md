> SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration,
> transactional SQL database engine. The code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free
> for use for any purpose, commercial or private.

SQLite follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) since [3.9.0](https://www.sqlite.org/versionnumbers.html).
Only the latest version is supported, but [various professional support options](https://www.sqlite.org/prosupport.html)
are available. The most notable one is the [Technical Support](https://sqlite.org/com/tech.html)
which gives access to support for any version of SQLite up to a year old.

Developers made a pledge to [_support SQLite through the year 2050_](https://www.sqlite.org/lts.html).
This doesn't mean they are supporting [all SQLite releases](https://www.sqlite.org/chronology.html),
it means they plan as if they will be supporting SQLite until 2050.
