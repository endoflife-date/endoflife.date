# releaseCycle 2 catches weekly releases, other are LTS.
# For an LTS :
# - Its support date is its release date, meaning there will never be backport of features.
# - Its EOL date is the releaseDate of the next LTS version, meaning the release date of the first
#   patch version of the minor version choosed to be the next LTS (e.g. 2.361.1).

> [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open source automation server. It helps automate the
> parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous
> integration and continuous delivery.

The Jenkins project produces two release lines: Stable (LTS) and regular (Weekly).

[Stable (LTS)](https://www.jenkins.io/download/lts/) releases are chosen every 12 weeks from the
stream of regular releases, and patched every 4 weeks with bug, security fix, and minor feature backports.

[Regular (Weekly)](https://www.jenkins.io/download/weekly/) releases deliver bug fixes and new
features rapidly to users and plugin developers who need them.
