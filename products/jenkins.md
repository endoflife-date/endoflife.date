# releaseCycle 2 catches weekly releases, other releases are LTS.
#
# LTS releases start at patch version .1 ('x.y.1') and, when a new LTS is released, it replaces the
# previous one. So, for an x.y LTS releases :
# - lts(x.y) = releaseDate(x.y.1)
# - releaseDate(x.y) = releaseDate(x.y.0)
# - eol(x.y) = releaseDate(next LTS)

> [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open source automation server. It helps automate the
> parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous
> integration and continuous delivery.

The Jenkins project produces two release lines: Stable (LTS) and regular (Weekly).

[Stable (LTS)](https://www.jenkins.io/download/lts/) releases are chosen every 12 weeks from the
stream of regular releases, and patched every 4 weeks with bug, security fix, and minor feature backports.

[Regular (Weekly)](https://www.jenkins.io/download/weekly/) releases deliver bug fixes and new
features rapidly to users and plugin developers who need them.
