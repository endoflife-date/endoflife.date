> [Mule Runtime engine](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/latest/) (Mule) is a lightweight
> integration engine that runs Mule applications and supports domains and policies. Mule
> applications, domains, and policies share an XML DSL (domain-specific language).

[Starting with Mule 4.5](https://docs.mulesoft.com/release-notes/mule-runtime/lts-edge-release-cadence),
MuleSoft introduces two new release channels: Edge and Long-term Support (LTS).

There are up to three Edge releases per year.
Edge releases are supported with Standard Support, which includes bug and security fixes, for 1 month after the next Edge version is released.
This is followed by 3 months of Extended Support, which includes critical bug and security fixes.

There is one LTS release per year (around February).
LTS releases are supported with a minimum of 18 months of Standard Support,
followed by a minimum of 6 months of Extended Support.


It is possible to switch from an Edge version to an LTS version and vice versa.
However, when moving from Edge to LTS, a later LTS version must be chosen.
