> [Apache Hop](https://hop.apache.org/), short for Hop Orchestration Platform, is an open source
> data orchestration and data engineering platform that aims to facilitate all aspects of data and
> metadata orchestration. Hop allows data professionals to work visually, using metadata to
> describe how data should be processed.

Apache Hop does not have a clear release, support and EOL policy. Looking at the latest releases on
15th October 2023, it seems that once a minor version is released it is never patched. It was
consequently considered only the latest minor version is supported.
