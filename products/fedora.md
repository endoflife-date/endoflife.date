> [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) is a Linux distribution developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat.

Fedora end of life dates are not typically known far in advance with to-the-day accuracy. Fedora has a relatively short life cycle: Release X is supported until one month (4 weeks) after the release of Release X+2 and with approximately 6 months between most versions, meaning a version of Fedora is usually supported for at least 13 months, possibly longer.

See [this link](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases) for a list of all releases, and [this link](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Life_Cycle) for more information about the Fedora Release Cycle. A list of all EOL releases can be found [here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life).
