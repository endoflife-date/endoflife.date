> [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) is a Linux distribution developed by the community-supported
> Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat.

Fedora end-of-life dates are not typically known far in advance with to-the-day accuracy. Fedora has
a relatively short life cycle: Release X is supported until 4 weeks after the release of
Release X+2 and with approximately 6 months between most versions, meaning a version of Fedora is
usually supported for at least 13 months, possibly longer.

- [List of all Releases](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/).
- [Fedora Project Schedule](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/) includes tentative dates.
- [Unsupported Fedora Linux releases](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/eol/).
