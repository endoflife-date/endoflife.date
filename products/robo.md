> [Robo](https://robo.li/) is a task runner written in PHP.

Supported releases are documented on <https://github.com/consolidation/robo#branches>.
All versions are roughly compatible; the breaking changes introduced at each major version are
fairly minor, and typically only affect classes that are not used by most clients.
