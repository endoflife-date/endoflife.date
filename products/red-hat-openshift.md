>[OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is a family of
> containerization software products developed by Red Hat. Its flagship product is the OpenShift
> Container Platform — a hybrid cloud platform as a service built around Linux containers
> orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Red Hat provides three different phases of support: Full Support, Maintenance Support and Extended
Update Support.

The **Full Support** phase begins at the GA/release of the minor version and ends after a 6 months
period OR 90 days after the GA of the superseding minor release, whichever is later. During the Full
Support Phase, qualified Critical and Important Security Advisories ([RHSAs][DEFINITION]) and Urgent
and Selected High Priority Bug Fix Advisories ([RHBAs][DEFINITION]) will be released as they become
available; all other available fix and qualified patches may be released via periodic updates.

The **Maintenance Support** phase commences after the Full Support phase for the respective minor
version and ends at 18 months after GA. During the Maintenance Support phase, qualified Critical and
Important Security Advisories (RHSAs) and Urgent and Selected High Priority Bug Fix Advisories
(RHBAs) may be released as they become available. Other Bug Fix and Enhancement Advisories
([RHEA][DEFINITION]) may be released at Red Hat’s discretion, but should not be expected.

The **Extended Update Support** phase commences after the Full Support phase for even numbered minor
releases (e.g. 4.8, 4.10, 4.12). Additionally, to the full support and maintenance support phases,
which also apply to EUS releases, upgrades between EUS releases will cause fewer reboots of nodes.
This was the only benefit of EUS releases before version 4.12. Starting from 4.12, Red Hat will
additionally include a six month EUS phase. The EUS phase will follow the maintenance phase for
the given release (18 months from GA date). This results in a total support time of 24 months for
EUS releases.
