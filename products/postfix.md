>[Postfix](https://www.postfix.org/) is Wietse Venema's mail server that started life at IBM
> research as an alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program. Now at Google, Wietse continues to
> support Postfix. Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure. The outside has a
> definite Sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.

Typically last 4 releases are supported and receive patches.
