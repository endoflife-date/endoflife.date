> [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages
> rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

**Feature releases** (A.B, A.B+1, etc.) will happen roughly every eight months. These releases will
contain new features, improvements to existing features, and such. These can include documented
backwards incompatibilities where a deprecation path isn’t possible or not worth the cost.

**Patch releases** (A.B.C, etc.) will be issued as needed, to fix bugs and/or security issues.
These releases will be 100% compatible with the associated feature release, unless this is
impossible for security reasons or to prevent data loss. So the answer to "should I upgrade to the
latest patch release?” will always be "yes."

The last feature release for a major version will be designated as long-term support (LTS) release.
These releases will get security and data loss fixes applied for a guaranteed period of time,
typically three years. Deprecations started in an LTS release (say X.2) will be dropped in a
non-dot-zero release (Y.1).

See the [supported versions policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/internals/release-process/#supported-versions)
for detailed guidelines about what fixes will be backported.
