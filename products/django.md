> [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

**Feature releases** (A.B, A.B+1, etc.) will happen roughly every eight months. These releases will contain new features, improvements to existing features, and such.

**Patch releases** (A.B.C, etc.) will be issued as needed, to fix bugs and/or security issues. These releases will be 100% compatible with the associated feature release, unless this is impossible for security reasons or to prevent data loss. So the answer to "should I upgrade to the latest patch release?‚Äù will always be "yes."

Certain feature releases will be designated as long-term support (LTS) releases. These releases will get security and data loss fixes applied for a guaranteed period of time, typically three years.

See the [supported versions policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/#supported-versions) for detailed guidelines about what fixes will be backported.
