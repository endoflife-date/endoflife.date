> [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/about/) is a community-developed, commercially supported relational
> database management system (RDBMS) originally forked from MySQL.

A new long-term release (LTS) of MariaDB Server will be announced for General Availability
approximately once every year. A new rolling release will be announced approximately quarterly.
The MariaDB Foundation guarantees that every long-term release will be maintained for at least
5 years. For 11.2 and before, non-LTS releases were described as short-term releases, and were
maintained for one year. From 11.3, these are rolling releases.
