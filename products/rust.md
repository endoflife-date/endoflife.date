> [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is an open source multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming
> language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety,
> meaning that all references point to valid memory, without requiring the use of automated memory
> management techniques such as garbage collection

A new stable release is produced every six weeks, like clock-work. Only the latest stable release
receives patches. Each new stable release spends the preceding six-week period as the Beta release.
There's also a new 'nightly' build every night, but I don't propose you list all of those.
