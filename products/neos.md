> [Neos](https://www.neos.io) is a highly extensible web-based content management system (CMS) written in PHP.

## Release schedule

Neos releases follow Semantic Versioning, and the team strives for a regular Neos release every four months:

- Three minor releases per year, with patch level releases as needed in between
- Major releases happen yearly, assuming there will be breaking changes
- Each release receives bug fixes for at least 1 year (extended by previous LTS) and security fixes for 1 additional year (at least 2 in total)
- Each Long Term Support (LTS) version receives bug fixes for 2 years and security fixes for 1 additional year (3 in total)

## [PHP Support](https://docs.neos.io/guide/installation-development-setup/system-requirements)

| Version | PHP       |
|---------|-----------|
| 8.x     | 8.0 - 8.3 |
| 7.3     | 7.3 - 8.1 |
