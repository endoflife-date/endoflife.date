> [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) is a collaborative software development effort
> aimed at creating a robust, commercial-grade, feature-rich and freely available source code
> implementation of an HTTP (Web) server.

The update and release strategy is _complex_ and is best described on the
[Apache HTTP Server Release Guidelines](https://httpd.apache.org/dev/release.html).
