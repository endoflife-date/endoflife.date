> [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/browsers/), is a free and open-source web browser
> developed by the Mozilla. Firefox is available for
> [Windows](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-install-firefox-windows),
> [macOS](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-download-and-install-firefox-mac),
> [Android](https://support.mozilla.org/products/mobile),
> [iOS](https://support.mozilla.org/products/ios),
> [Linux](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/install-firefox-linux), and
> [ChromeOS](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/run-firefox-chromeos).

## Firefox has two main release channels:

- **Firefox:** Simply named Firefox, this is the default channel and is the one recommended. It's
  the stable branch with the latest features available. Once a new release is out, the older release
  immediately stops receiving support and everyone must migrate to the next Firefox release.
- **Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR):** is an official version of Firefox developed for large
  organizations like universities and businesses that need to set up and maintain Firefox on a large
  scale. Firefox ESR does not come with the latest features, but it has the latest security and
  stability fixes. Usually these branches are supported for a year,
  [with a planned release calendar for new ESR branches.](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar)
  For more information you should review the [release cycle documentation.](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-esr-release-cycle)

## Firefox also has three testing channels:

- **Firefox Beta:** This branch is meant to reflect what the next **Firefox** release will look
  like. Every four weeks it gets cherry-picked changes from **Nightly**, then follows a three weekly
  point release aimed at stabilizing the release for the stable branch. Version number is always
  `X + 1`, `X` being the **Firefox** version number.
- **Firefox Developer Edition:** This branch is based off the **Firefox Beta** branch with
  additional DevTools merged in. It gets released alongside the **Firefox Beta** release, following
  the same release pattern. Version number is always `X + 1`, `X` being the **Firefox** version
  number.
- **Firefox Nightly:** This is the branch that receives all the changes before anything else. It
  gets daily updates which represent the master branch. This is the branch that first features new
  changes/features, which then may be forwarded to **Firefox Beta** after being tested. Version
  number is always `X + 2`, `X` being the **Firefox** version number.

## Special notes

- Firefox 78 ESR was the last version of Firefox that supported macOS versions < 10.12 or Flash.
- Firefox only supports last 3 macOS releases, [matching the Apple support cycle.](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-mac-osx-users-esr)
