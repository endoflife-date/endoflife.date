> Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox is available for Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, and Solaris Unix. Firefox is also available for Android and iOS.

## Firefox has two main release channels:

 - Firefox: Simply named Firefox, this is the default channel and is the one recommended. It's the stable branch with the latest features available. Once a new release is out, the older release immediately stops receiving support and everyone must migrate to the next Firefox release.

 - Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR): is an official version of Firefox developed for large organizations like universities and businesses that need to set up and maintain Firefox on a large scale. Firefox ESR does not come with the latest features but it has the latest security and stability fixes. Usually these branches are supported for a year, [with a planned release calendar for new ESR branches.](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar)



## Special notes 

- Firefox 78 ESR is the last version of Firefox that supports Flash. The last version of that ESR will be 78.15, which is scheduled to be released on 2021-10-05. This means that Flash will officially be out of support on Firefox when Firefox 78 ESR reaches EOL on 2021-11-02. 

- Firefox 78 ESR is the last version of Firefox that supports macOS versions < 10.12.
