> [Apertis](https://www.apertis.org/) is a versatile Open Source GNU/Linux distribution,
> based on Debian, and a feature-rich infrastructure. Originally tailored to automotive use
> cases, it has grown to be a fit for a wide variety of electronic devices with security and
> modularity as two of its primary strengths. Apertis provides extensive software management
> (from source code to signed binary packages in repositories), a complete testing framework
> including hardware-in-loop, and resilient upgrade capabilities. Beyond an operating system,
> it offers tools and cloud services to optimise development and increase reliability.

At any given time, there are two stable releases of Apertis, both based on the latest Debian
stable and on the latest Linux LTS kernel at the release time.
Each Apertis release is supported for around two years as described in the
[release flow documentation](https://www.apertis.org/policies/release-flow/).

A [commercial support](https://www.apertis.org/overview/commercial-support/) is available
to adapt Apertis to users' requirements.
