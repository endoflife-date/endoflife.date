> [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking and continuous integration and deployment pipeline features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc.

GitLab has a [well-defined versioning policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/policy/maintenance.html) based on Semantic Versioning. New releases are announced on the [blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/), and you can subscribe to an [RSS Feed](https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml) as well. A [tool is available](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/cs-tools/gitlab-cs-tools/what-is-new-since/?tab=features) to track new features since a given version.

| Version Type | Description  | Cadence |
|:-------------|:-------------|:--------|
| Major        | For significant changes, or when any backward-incompatible changes are introduced to the public API.  |  Yearly. Subsequent major releases will be scheduled for May 22 each year, by default. |
| Minor        | For when new backward-compatible functionality is introduced to the public API, a minor feature is introduced, or when a set of smaller features is rolled out.  | Monthly on the 22nd.  |
| Patch        | 	For backward-compatible bug fixes that fix incorrect behavior.  | As needed.  |
