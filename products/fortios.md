> [FortiOS][fortios] is Fortinet's operating system used in their hardware, such as the FortiGate
> firewall and switches. It is based on Linux.

Fortinet offers the following major lifecycle milestones:

1. **End of Order** (`EOO`): is last date on which a product may be ordered
2. **Last Service Extension Date** (`LSED`): The last date at which a service extension is accepted
   for an existing contract, for a hardware or software product. This is 12 months before the EOS
   date for most products, and 90 days after the End-of-life notification for stand-alone services.
3. **End of Engineering Support for Software** (`EOES`): The date beyond which Fortinet no longer
   commits to provide engineering support for software. After this date the software enters a
   **must-fix** support phase, during which, maintenance builds will only be produced for
   industry-wide critical issues and PSIRT vulnerabilities. The EOES date is generally 36 months
   after the GA date.
4. **End of Support Date** (`EOS`): Fortinet will not sell, manufacture or improve the product
   after this date and is under no obligation to provide support services. In general the EOS takes
   place as follows:
   - Hardware - 60 months after the EOO Date
   - Software - 54 months after the GA date
   - Stand-alone Services – on the service contract termination date

This page tracks the End of Engineering Support and End of Support dates for FortiOS. The support
website for Fortinet requires a free FortiCloud account, which can be created [here][signup].
