> [FortiOS][fortios] is Fortinet's operating system used in their hardware, such as the Fortigate firewall and switches. It is based on Linux.

Fortinet offers the following major lifecycle milestones:

1. **End of Order** (`EOO`): is last date on which a product may be ordered
2. **Last Service Extension Date** (`LSED`): The last date at which a service extension is accepted for an
existing contract, for a hardware or software product. This is 12 months before the EOS date for most products, and 90 days after the End-of-life notification for stand-alone services.
3. **End of Engineering Support for Software** (`EOES`): The date beyond which Fortinet no longer commits to
provide engineering support for software. After this date the software enters a **must-fix** support phase,
during which, maintenance builds will only be produced for industry-wide critical issues and PSIRT
vulnerabilities. The EOES date is generally 36 months after the GA date.
4. **End of Support Date** (`EOS`): Fortinet will not sell, manufacture or improve the product after this date and is under no obligation to provide support services. In general the EOS takes place as follows:
  - Hardware - 60 months after the EOO Date
  - Software - 54 months after the GA date
  - Stand-alone Services â€“ on the service contract termination date

This page tracks the End of Engineering Support and End of Support dates for FortiOS. The support website for Fortinet requires a free FortiCloud account, which can be created [here][signup]
