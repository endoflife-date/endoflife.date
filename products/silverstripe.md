For major releases that are in "Active development" or "Full support", minor versions are released
approximately every three months, and their End-of-Life (EOL) is announced at least six months in
advance. The latest minor release is supported as long as its underlying major release.

Silverstripe 5 will receive security fixes till April 2027.

Bug and security fixes are managed differently depending on whether the underlying major release is
in "Full support" or "Limited support". For more information, read the
[Release Process](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/5/contributing/release_process/) documentation.
