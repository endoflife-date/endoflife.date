> The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. that use Apple's iOS
> mobile operating system.

Most likely, new iPhone models will come out in September every year (with a few possible
exceptions). iPhone support (supported devices gets the latest iOS updates) is quite long. Apple
occasionally releases security updates for much older devices, such as
[this security fix in iOS 12.5.6](https://support.apple.com/HT213428) which was pushed to iPhone 6
and iPhone 5S.

On new iOS releases, the [previous iOS version is supported for a few months](https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-running-ios-14-on-your-iphone-apple-brings-support-to-an-end/)
as a stop-gap to allow users time to update.

Apple maintains a list of Supported iPhone models at <https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphe3fa5df43>.

Support information for iOS versions are available at [/ios](/ios).
