> The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. that use Apple's iOS mobile operating system.

Most likely, new iPhone models will come out in September every year (with a few possible exceptions). iPhone support (supported devices gets the latest iOS updates) is quite long. Apple occasionally releases security updates for much older devices, such as [this security fix in iOS 12.5.2](https://support.apple.com/HT212257) which was pushed to iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S.

Apple maintains a list of Supported iPhone models at <https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphe3fa5df43>.
