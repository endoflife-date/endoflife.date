> [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/) is a general-purpose GNU/Linux distribution that aims to be most ["UNIX-like", simple and stable](http://www.slackware.com/info/). It strives to minimize the number of changes to upstream software releases.  It is the oldest actively developed GNU/Linux distribution with development being led by creator Patrick Volkerding continuously since 1993.

There are several releases of Slackware Linux supported concurrently.  A [stability based release cycle](http://www.slackware.com/faq/do_faq.php?faq=general#4) is used and therefore releases are not due on a fixed schedule. A new release is usually made once every few years.

Slackware's `-current` development tree closely follows bleeding edge of upstream releases. The latest stable release gets bug and security fixes while previous non End-of-Life releases receive only security patches.

Slackware officially supports 32-bit non-PAE (i586-compatible), 32-bit PAE (i686-compatible) and 64-bit x86 processors.  Unofficial builds are available for the arm and s/390 architectures.

Security Advisories are published [here](http://www.slackware.com/security/), and can be subscribed via the [slackware-security](http://www.slackware.com/lists/) mailing list.
