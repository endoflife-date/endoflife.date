> Intel designs CPUs for the consumer and commercial space that are named after lakes, which are
> supported on Microsoft Windows, Linux and macOS.

## Support exceptions

- Intel Compute Support can be found [here](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime#supported-platforms),
  with quality expectations per platform found [in the release notes](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases).
- While a CPU may be under security support it may not be supported on a specific Windows release,
  more information on this can be found [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000032181/processors/intel-core-processors.html).
- A CPU's iGPU may not be supported by the latest GPU driver branch even if still supported.

## Determining product classification

One can run the following command depending on your operating system to see which product series
your CPU belongs on:

- Windows: `Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor` on Powershell
- Linux: `cat /proc/cpuinfo`
- macOS: `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string`
- FreeBSD/OpenBSD: `sysctl -n hw.model`

Then check product classification on https://ark.intel.com/.
