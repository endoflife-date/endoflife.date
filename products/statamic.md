> [Statamic](https://statamic.com/) is a modern and flexible content management system built on the [Laravel PHP framework](/laravel).
> It uses flat files for content storage, making it easy to version control.

Statamic and its other first-party packages follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
Major framework releases are released every year, following [Laravel's](/laravel) major releases by roughly a month.

For all Statamic releases, bug fixes are provided for at least 12 months and security fixes for at least 18 months.
For all first party addons, only the latest major release receives bug fixes.
