> [cnspec](https://mondoo.com/cnspec/) is an open source, cloud-native security and policy tool.
> It assesses an entire infrastructure's security and compliance and finds vulnerabilities and
> misconfigurations across public and private cloud environments, Kubernetes clusters, containers,
> container registries, servers, endpoints, SaaS products, infrastructure as code, APIs, and more.

cnspec follows an N-1 support strategy, meaning the current major version (N) and the immediate previous major version (N-1) are officially supported with non-breaking changes, bug and security fixes. During this time, both major versions can communicate with the Mondoo Platform and execute all published policies and query packs.
