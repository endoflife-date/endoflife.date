> [Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket) is a corporate source control and CI/CD platform
> developed by Atlassian.

{: .warning }
> Atlassian ended support for Bitbucket Server [on February 15, 2024](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/journey-to-cloud).
> Starting from 8.15.x, new releases of Bitbucket are available only to Data Center customers.

Bitbucket is available both as SaaS and on-premises offer, with two editions:

- Bitbucket Cloud: Cloud edition, available through [Atlassian Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/cloud).
- Bitbucket Data Center: Self-hosted edition, targeted to enterprises.

This page is **only** about Bitbucket Data Center. Bitbucket Cloud is a
part of the Atlassian Cloud with [its own release cadence](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog).

Bitbucket has both LTS and non-LTS releases. There is approximately one LTS release per year,
which receive security support and bug fixes for 2 years. The non-LTS releases are rarely
backported for security and bug fixes, which means that you have to watch patch notes and keep up
with current releases to keep your installation secure.

More information about enterprise LTS releases can be found in
[this article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/enterprise/introducing-enterprise-releases).
