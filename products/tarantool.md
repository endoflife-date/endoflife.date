> [Tarantool](https://www.tarantool.io/) is an open source (BSD-2 clause licensed), in-memory
> computing platform consisting of a database and an application server. It includes a heavily
> optimized Lua interpreter, cooperative multitasking and non-blocking IO, persistent queues,
> sharding, and MySQL/PostgreSQL support.

The Tarantool release policy is changing to become more clear and intuitive. The new policy uses a
[SemVer-like](https://semver.org/) versioning format, and introduces a new version lifecycle with
more long-time support series. This document explains the new release policy, versioning rules, and
[release series](https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/release/policy/#term-Release-series)
lifecycle.

The new release policy replaces the [legacy policy](https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/release/legacy-policy/)
for 2.x.y series since 2.10.0 release and all future series (3.x.y and so on).

Here are the most significant changes from the legacy release policy:

- The third number in the version label doesn’t distinguish between pre-release (alpha and beta) and
  release versions. Instead, it is used for patch (bugfix-only) releases. Pre-release versions have
  suffixes, like `3.0.0-alpha1`.
- In the legacy release policy, `1.10` was a long-term support (LTS) series, while `2.x.y` had
  stable releases, but wasn’t an LTS series. Now both series are long-term supported.

[2.11](https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/release/2.11.0/) is the long-term support (LTS) release with four years of maintenance.
