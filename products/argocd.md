> [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io) is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

Only the three most recent minor versions are eligible for patch releases.
Versions older than the three most recent minor versions are considered End-of-Life
and do not receive bug fixes or security updates.

## [Release Cadence](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/)

A minor release occurs four times a year, once every three months. Patch releases occur on an as-needed basis.
