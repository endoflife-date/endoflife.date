> Nvidia CUDAÂ® is a parallel computing platform and programming model that enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU). [1]


> The CUDA driver provides an API that is backwards compatible. Thus, new NVIDIA drivers will always work with (applications compiled with) an older CUDA toolkit. [2]

> Each CUDA Toolkit however, requires a minimum version of the NVIDIA driver.
> Corollarily, when using tools such as nvidia-smi, the NVIDIA driver reports a maximum version of CUDA supported and thus is able to run applications built with CUDA Toolkits up to that version. [3]

> CUDA Toolkit and drivers may also deprecate and drop support for GPU architectures over the product life cycle of the CUDA Toolkit. [4]
