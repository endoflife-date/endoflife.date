> [Memcached](https://www.memcached.org/) is a free and open source, high-performance, distributed
> memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web
> applications by alleviating database load. Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small
> chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page
> rendering.

Memcached is community-supported, and doesn't have a clearly defined release and support policy.
[Based on the latest releases](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/ReleaseNotes), it
appears that only the latest release is supported.
