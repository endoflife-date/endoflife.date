> [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) is an open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database implemented
> in Erlang. CouchDB uses various formats and protocols to store, transfer, and
> process data, with JSON as its primary data storage format.

CouchDB maintains the two most recent releases for CVEs. Older versions are
not supported, but they may publish further backports at their discretion.
