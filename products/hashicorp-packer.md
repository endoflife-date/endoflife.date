> [Hashicorp Packer](https://www.packer.io/) Packer is a community tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. 


**Generally Available (GA)** releases of active products are supported under standard maintenance approximately
for a year. The standard support period and end of life policy covers "N−2" versions,
which means, at any given time, HashiCorp maintains the current version ("N") and the two previous versions ("N−2").


## Versioning and Release Cadence

A major release is identified by a change in the first (X) or second (Y) digit in the following
versioning nomenclature: `Version X.Y.Z.`
