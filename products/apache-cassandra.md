> [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org) is a free and open-source, distributed, wide-column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

Three major GA releases (MAJOR and/or MINOR versions) are supported at any given time. The release of a new MINOR or MAJOR version will cause the oldest supported GA release to go End-of-Life. The 3.0 release will be supported for one more cycle, on an exceptional basis.

## [Versioning](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/blog/Behind-the-scenes-of-an-Apache-Cassandra-Release.html)

Cassandra follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/). These are the rough heuristics followed for what can be included in a given release.

* Patch releases on a GA branch should only include bug fixes.
* Minor versions are always upgradable without downtime from any minor version from the previous major version. For example an upgrade from a 3.x version to a 5.x version is not supported. Only upgrades stepping through each major version (3.x -> 4.x -> 5.x) are supported.
* Disruptive changes that prevent always-up upgrades from the previous major versions are deferred to the next-to-next major version.

As an always-on technology, Cassandra does not break user-facing API compatabilities without a deprecated grace period demarcated by major versions.

## Release Cadence

The project currently targets yearly major releases (can be a new major or minor version, depending on upgrade compatability). Patch releases are cut based on either volume of fixes or severity of bugfixes that get committed to the project.
