> [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org) is a free and open-source, distributed,
> wide-column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data
> across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

Three major GA releases (MAJOR and/or MINOR versions) are supported at any given time. The release
of a new MINOR or MAJOR version will cause the oldest supported GA release to go End-of-Life.
The 3.0 release will be supported for one more cycle, on an exceptional basis.

## [Versioning](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/blog/Behind-the-scenes-of-an-Apache-Cassandra-Release.html)

Cassandra follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/). These are the rough heuristics followed for what
can be included in a given release.

- Patch releases on a GA branch should only include bug fixes.
- Minor versions contain new features and improvements, and are always compatible with all minor versions in the same and adjacent (next-to-next) major versions.
- Disruptive changes (API changes, protocol changes, etc.) are deprecated in the next Major version.  Deprecated APIs may then be removed in the next-next Major version.

As an always-on technology during major upgrades, Cassandra maintains compatibility across adjacent
major versions. Cassandra does not break API compatibility without a deprecated grace period
demarcated by major versions. Upgrades without downtime are supported from any major version to the
next major version. Upgrades that skip a major version are not supported. For e.g. an upgrade from
a 3.x version to a 5.x version is not supported. Only upgrades stepping through each major version
(3.x -> 4.x -> 5.x) are supported.

## Release Cadence

The project currently targets yearly major releases (can be a new major or minor version, depending
on upgrade compatibility). Patch releases are cut based on either volume of fixes or severity of
bugfixes that get committed to the project.
