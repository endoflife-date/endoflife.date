> [policy-controller](https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller) The policy-controller admission controller can be used to enforce policy on a Kubernetes cluster based on verifiable supply-chain metadata from cosign.

The project is planning to move to a monthly cadence for minor releases. These will be published around the beginning of the month. A patch release might be made instead if the changes are small enough.
