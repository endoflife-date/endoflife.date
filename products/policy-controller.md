> [policy-controller](https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller) The policy-controller admission controller can be used to enforce policy on a Kubernetes cluster based on verifiable supply-chain metadata from cosign.

We are intending to move to a monthly cadence for minor releases. Minor releases will be published around the beginning of the month. We may cut a patch release instead, if the changes are small enough not to warrant a minor release. We will also cut patch releases periodically as needed to address bugs.
