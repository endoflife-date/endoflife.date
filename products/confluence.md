> [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) is a web-based corporate wiki
> developed by Atlassian.

Confluence is available both as SaaS and on-premises offer, with three editions:

- Confluence Cloud: Cloud edition, available through [Atlassian Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/cloud).
- Confluence Server: Self-hosted edition.
- Confluence Data Center: Self-hosted edition, targeted to enterprises (see [Confluence Server and Data
  Center feature comparison](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-server-and-data-center-feature-comparison-953652032.html)
  for more information).

This page is **only** about Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center. Confluence Cloud is a part
of the Atlassian Cloud with [its own release cadence](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog).

Confluence has both LTS and non-LTS releases. There is approximately one LTS release per year,
which receive security support and bug fixes for 2 years. The non-LTS releases are rarely backported
for security and bug fixes, which means that you have to watch patch notes and keep up with current
releases to keep your install secure.

More information about enterprise LTS releases can be found in 
[this article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/enterprise/introducing-enterprise-releases).
Information about Atlassian Support End of Life Policy can be found in
[this article](https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-support-end-of-life-policy-201851003.html).

Atlassian will end support for Confluence Server
[on February 15, 2024](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/journey-to-cloud),
but Confluence Data Center will still be available.
