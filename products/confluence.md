> [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) is a web-based corporate wiki
> developed by Atlassian.

Confluence is available both as SaaS and on-premises offer, with three editions:

- Confluence Cloud: Cloud edition, available through [Atlassian Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/cloud).
- Confluence Server: Self-hosted edition.
- Confluence Data Center: Self-hosted edition, targeted to enterprises (see [Confluence Server and Data
  Center feature comparison](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-server-and-data-center-feature-comparison-953652032.html)
  for more information).

This page is **only** about Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center. Confluence Cloud is a part
of the Atlassian Cloud with [its own release cadence](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog).

Confluence has both LTS and non-LTS releases. There is approximately one LTS release per year,
which receive security support and bug fixes for 2 years. Non-LTS releases are supported for
6 months (there may be some exception). More information can be found in
[this article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/enterprise/introducing-enterprise-releases).

Atlassian will end support for Confluence Server
[on February 15, 2024](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/journey-to-cloud),
but Confluence Data Center will still be available.
