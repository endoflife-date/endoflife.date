> Git (`git`) is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of
computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively
developing source code during software development.
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear
workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

> Git was originally authored by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)
in 2005 for development of the [Linux kernel](https://endoflife.date/linux), with other
kernel developers contributing on its initial development.

> Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed
version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory
on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full
version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.

> Git is free and open-source software distributed under the
[`GPL-2.0-only`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) license.
