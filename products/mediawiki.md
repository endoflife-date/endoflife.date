> [MediaWiki](https://mediawiki.org) is a wiki engine, and mostly known as the software that powers
> Wikipedia, but it is also frequently used for other wikis.

MediaWiki releases are made about every 6 months, with every fourth release (i.e. about every 2
years) being an LTS (Long-Term Support) release branch. LTS release branches receive security
support and bug fixes for three years after their initial release, while non-LTS release branches
are supported for one year after their initial release.

Since Version 1.36, MediaWiki only supports [upgrading from two major long-term support releases
(LTS) ago](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T259771 "RFC: Drop support for older database upgrades on MediaWiki Phabricator").
Upgrades from older versions of MediaWiki will have to be performed in multiple steps.
