> [Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/) is a MongoDB-compatible proprietary NoSQL database service
> managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Amazon DocumentDB does not follow the same support lifecycles as MongoDB and MongoDB's end-of-life schedule does not apply to Amazon DocumentDB.
Supported releases are documented in [Amazon DocumentDB documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/docdb-version-support-dates.html).
