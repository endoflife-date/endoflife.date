> [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) is an event-driven, serverless computing platform
> provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services. It is designed to enable developers to run
> code without provisioning or managing servers. It executes code in response to events and
> automatically manages the computing resources required by that code.

## Supported runtimes

AWS Lambda supports the following runtimes:

- [Node.js](/nodejs)
- [Python](/python)
- [Ruby](/ruby)
- [Java](/amazon-corretto)
- [Go](/go)
- [.NET Core](/dotnet)

## Runtime updates

Runtime updates are, most of the time, backward compatible with existing functions. But, in some
rare cases, a runtime update can negatively impact an existing function. An example of such case
is a lamda that make use of an insecure behavior fixed by a security patch.

There are three modes of runtime updates:

- Auto (default): functions are automatically updated to the most recent runtime version.
- Function update: runtime update is applied at function update.
- Manual: runtime version is set in the function configuration.

[Responsibility for applying runtime updates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html#runtime-management-shared)
varies according to chosen runtime update mode.

## Runtime deprecation

Deprecation (end of support) for a runtime occurs in two phases.

- Phase 1: Security patches or other updates are no longer applied, and new functions that use the
  runtime cannot be created. Functions that use a deprecated runtime are also no longer eligible
  for technical support.
- Phase 2: Existing functions that use the runtime cannot be updated, and rollback to that runtime
  is no more possible. Phase 2 starts at least 30 days after the start of Phase 1.

Invocations of functions that use deprecated runtime is never blocked.
