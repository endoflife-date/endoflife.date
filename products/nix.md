> [nix](https://nixos.org/) is a cross-platform package manager that utilizes a purely functional deployment model where software is installed into unique directories generated through cryptographic hashes. It is also the name of the tool's programming language. A package's hash takes into account the dependencies, which is claimed to eliminate dependency hell. This package management model advertises more reliable, reproducible, and portable packages.
