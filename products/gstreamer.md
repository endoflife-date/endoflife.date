> [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) is a pipeline-based
> multimedia framework that links together a wide variety of media
> processing systems to complete complex workflows. For instance,
> GStreamer can be used to build a system that reads files in one
> format, processes them, and exports them in another. The formats and
> processes can be changed in a plug and play fashion.

GStreamer follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Moreover,
GStreamer is using the following version policy:

- Stable releases (ready for production use) are even numbers, such as
  1.0, 1.2 or 1.4.
- Development releases are odd numbers, such as 1.1, 1.3 or 1.5.

The support and EOL policy is not clearly defined. But, looking at the
releases history, there is at least a `x.y` release every year which
is supported for at least a year with important bug fixes.
