> The [IBM Semeru Runtimes](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/) are free
> production-ready binaries built with the OpenJDK class libraries and the Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM.
> Release builds [pass the full suite of open tests that are available from the Eclipse AQAvit
> project](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/semeru-runtime-quality-you-can-depend-on/).

IBM Semeru Runtimes builds are available for LTS as well as non-LTS JDK releases, but only LTS
builds are supported.

The LTS release cadence is currently one release every 2 years, supported until the upstream OpenJDK
maintenance ends (at least 2 years, but usually much more). Security updates and bug fixes are
released quarterly.

IBM Semeru Runtimes is one of the many builds of OpenJDK. For recommendations on which JDK build to
use, check out [whichjdk.com](https://whichjdk.com/#ibm-semeru-runtime).
