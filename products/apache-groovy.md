> [Apache Groovy](https://www.groovy-lang.org/) is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing
> and static compilation capabilities, for the Java platform aimed at improving developer productivity thanks to a
> concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to
> your application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-Specific Language authoring, runtime and
> compile-time meta-programming and functional programming.

Apache Groovy does not have a fixed release policy. Its support policy states that each new major version makes the
previous major version go into maintenance. Versions that are into maintenance are maintained for one or two bugfix
releases and then discontinued, unless there are strong requests to have certain things fixed for users that can
absolutely not upgrade. Groovy 2.5 and Groovy 3.0 are still supported because they are still in widespread use.

In Groovy 4.0, the groupId of the maven coordinates for Groovy have changed from `org.codehaus.groovy` to `org.apache.groovy`.

Groovy have [the following JVM requirements](https://groovy.apache.org/download.html):

| Groovy | JVM Required (non-indy) | JVM Required (indy) |
|--------|:------------------------|---------------------|
| 4.0    | N/A                     | 8+                  |
| 3.0    | 8+                      | 8+                  |
| 2.5    | 7+                      | 7+                  |
| 2.4    | 6+                      | 7+                  |
