> [Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops](https://www.citrix.com/products/citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops/)
> (CVAD) provides virtualization solutions that give IT control of virtual machines, applications,
> and security while providing anywhere access for any device.

Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops was previously known as XenApp and XenDesktop, re-branded in 2018.

There are two release types for on-premises deployments, Current Releases and Long Term Service
Releases (LTSR):
- Current Releases will reach end of active support 6 months after release and end of security
  support 18 months after release.
- Long Term Service Releases will reach end of active and security support 5 years after release.
  Incremental updates are delivered in the form of Cumulative Updates (CU). LTSR is also eligible
  for [paid extended support](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX459999/extended-support-customer-guide) up to 5 years after active and security support ends.

This page tracks the on-premise version of the product, and not the cloud-hosted version (Citrix
Virtual Apps and Desktops _service_).
