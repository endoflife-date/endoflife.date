> [Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops](https://www.citrix.com/products/citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops/) (CVAD) provides virtualization solutions that give IT control of virtual machines, applications, and security while providing anywhere access for any device.

Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops was previously known as XenApp and XenDesktop, re-branded in 2018.

There are two release types for on-premises deployments, Current Releases and Long Term Service Releases (LTSR).

* Current Releases will reach end of active support 6 months after release and end of security support 18 months after release.
* Long Term Service Releases will reach end of active and security support 5 years after release. Incremental updates are delivered in the form of Cumulative Updates (CU). LTSR is also eligible for [paid extended support](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX459999/extended-support-customer-guide) up to 5 years after active and security support ends.

This page tracks the on-premise version of the product, and not the cloud-hosted version (Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops _service_).
