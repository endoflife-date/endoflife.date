> [Adobe ColdFusion](http://coldfusion.com) is java-based commercial web application server and development platform from Adobe.

ColdFusion's lifecycle is typically 5 years after release, with new releases usually about every two years. Adobe has a [Support Lifecycle Policy](https://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/policy-pricing/policy_enterprise_lifecycle.html) page as well.

Adobe provides an "Extended maintenance and support" option with additional two year of Maintenance and support services after the end of Core Support Period for a 25% premium of the annual support for the current renewal term.
