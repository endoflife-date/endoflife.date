> [The OpenBSD project](https://www.openbsd.org/) produces a free, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based
> UNIX-like operating system. It emphasizes portability, standardization, correctness, proactive
> security and integrated cryptography.

OpenBSD has a new release every six months. Only the two most recent releases receive security and
reliability fixes for the base system.

## [Release Flavors](https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq5.html#Flavors "OpenBSD FAQ, Flavors Section")

- `-release`: The version of OpenBSD shipped every six months.
- `-current`: The development branch. Every six months, `-current` is tagged and becomes the next
  `-release`.
- `-stable`: The `-release` branch, plus patches found on the [OpenBSD errata page](https://www.openbsd.org/errata.html).
  Very important fixes are backported to the supported `-stable` branches.

OpenBSD publishes announcements and security advisories on the [announcements mailing list](https://lists.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&extra=announce).
There's an RSS feed for [errata](https://undeadly.org/errata/errata.rss "Undeadly Errata RSS feed")
as well.
