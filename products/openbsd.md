> [The OpenBSD project](https://www.openbsd.org/) produces a free, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. It emphasizes portability, standardization, correctness, proactive security and integrated cryptography.

OpenBSD has a new release every six months. Only the two most recent releases receive security and reliability fixes for the base system.

## [Release Flavors][flavors]

* `-release`: The version of OpenBSD shipped every six months.
* `-current`: The development branch. Every six months, `-current` is tagged and becomes the next `-release`.
* `-stable`: The `-release` branch, plus patches found on [the errata page][errata]. Very important fixes are backported to the supported `-stable` branches.

OpenBSD publishes announcements and security advisories on the [announcements mailing list][announce-ml]. There's an RSS feed for [errata][errata-rss] as well.

[errata]: https://www.openbsd.org/errata.html "OpenBSD Errata Page"
[errata-rss]: https://undeadly.org/errata/errata.rss "Undeadly Errata RSS feed"
[announce-ml]: https://lists.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&extra=announce "announce@"
