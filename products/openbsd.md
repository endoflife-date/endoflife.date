> [The OpenBSD project](https://www.openbsd.org/) produces a free, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. It emphasizes portability, standardization, correctness, proactive security and integrated cryptography.

The initial release, OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996, followed by OpenBSD 2.0 in October of the same year. Since then, the project has issued a release every six months. Only the two most recent OpenBSD releases receive security and reliability fixes for the base system. Learn more about OpenBSD's flavors in [OpenBSD FAQ](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq5.html#Flavors). See OpenBSD errata on a [web page](https://www.openbsd.org/errata.html), subscribe to [mailing list](https://lists.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&extra=announce) or [RSS feed](https://undeadly.org/errata/errata.rss).
