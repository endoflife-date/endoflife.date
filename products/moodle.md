> [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) is a Learning Platform or course management system (CMS) - a free Open Source software package designed to help educators create effective online courses based on sound pedagogical principles.

Major (eg. 3.x) releases are made every 6 months, Second Monday of May and November. Minor (eg. 3.x.y) releases are made every 2 months, Second Monday of July, September, November, January, March and May. 

From Moodle 2.6 onwards, the end of support, both general and security, happens the second Monday of May and November, observing the 12, 18... month periods, no matter if the major release was delayed or not.
