> [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) is a Java VM and JDK based on HotSpot/OpenJDK, implemented in
> Java. It supports additional programming languages and execution modes, like ahead-of-time
> compilation of Java applications for fast startup and low memory footprint.

GraalVM Community release cadence is fixed. There is one feature release every three months, always
on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the months of January, April, July, and October. Each feature
release supersedes any previous one, except annual releases.

Each year, the fourth feature release (for example 22.3) receives bugfixes for the next 12 months.
Such releases are called annual releases.

A commercial offering with long term support is provided by Oracle as
[GraalVM Enterprise](https://docs.oracle.com/en/graalvm/index.html).
