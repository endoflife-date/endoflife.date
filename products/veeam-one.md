Veeam One is available in two editions: Community (free) and Enterprise (paid). This page only covers the Enterprise edition.

Support for Veeam One always requires an active maintenance contract and is divided into two phases:

1. **End of Fix:** During this phase, updates, patches, and hotfixes are provided for the product.
2. **End of Support:** Updates, patches, and hotfixes may be provided during this phase but are subject to availability. If an issue is fixed in a later supported version, an update to that version is required.

This page uses GA dates as release dates unless otherwise stated.

Support for Veeam One always require an active maintenance contract and is divided
into two phases.

provided during this phase, but on a case-by-case basis. If Veeam determines that an issue is fixed
in a later supported generally available version, an update to the later release is required.
