> [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) is a minimal and flexible Node.js
> web application framework used for building web servers and APIs.

Express follows [semver](https://semver.org). Major versions marked as
supported on <https://expressjs.com/en/support/> receive non-breaking
updates, as well as bug and security fixes.

Releases that are EOL (end-of-life) may receive updates for critical
security vulnerabilities, but the Express team offers no guarantee and
does not plan to address or release fixes for any issues found.

The Express team has indicated that they will be participating in the
[OpenJS Foundationâ€™s Ecosystem Sustainability Program](https://openjsf.org/ecosystem-sustainability-program)
(ESP) and have announced that [commercial support for EOL branches](https://expressjs.com/en/support) is
now available through [HeroDevs](https://www.herodevs.com/support/express-nes).
