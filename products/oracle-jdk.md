> [Oracle Java SE Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/) is a commercial,
> closed-source, TCK-tested and certified build of OpenJDK. Builds of Oracle JDK are available for
> multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS and Linux.

Oracle JDK follows the same cadence as OpenJDK, with a 6-month rapid-release cycle (since the
release of Java 10) and a new LTS release every 2 years (since OpenJDK 17, previously every 3 years).

Oracle JDK follows the [Oracle Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/),
which defines 3 support levels:

- Premier Support: includes minor improvements, bug and security fixes for a minimum of 5 years from
  the general availability.
- Extended Support (LTS releases only): includes minor improvements, bug and security fixes for an
  additional 3 years from the end of Premier Support.
- Sustaining Support (LTS releases only): includes assistance from Oracle for an indefinite period,
  but with no bug nor security fixes.

Oracle JDK is free of charge for development and testing, but [may not be for production depending
on the release](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk-faqs.html). In 2021, Oracle
announced that [Oracle JDK 17 and later will be free for production](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/free-java-license),
but you should be cautious [as the situation is not that simple](https://bell-sw.com/announcements/2022/02/24/java-licensing-changes-in-2021/).
For example support for LTS releases [is limited to a year after the next LTS release](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

Oracle JDK is one of the many builds of OpenJDK. For recommendations on which JDK build to use,
check out [whichjdk.com](https://whichjdk.com/#oracle-java-se-development-kit-jdk).

{: .warning }
> This page also lists deprecated releases 1.0 to 6 of the JDK for information purposes.
> Those versions were released under the Sun Microsystems umbrella, before
> [its acquisition by Oracle in 2010](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems).
> They were not based on OpenJDK and were following a different support policy.
