> [Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform](https://www.redhat.com/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform)
> (or JBoss EAP) is a subscription-based Java EE-based application server runtime platform used for
> building, deploying, and hosting highly-transactional Java applications and services. It is
> developed and maintained by Red Hat as part as their Enterprise Middleware portfolio of software.
> It is based on the open source [WildFly application server](https://www.wildfly.org/).

{: .warning }
> JBoss EAP 7 received 7 years of Full Support. Given this exceptionally long Full Support phase,
> it is expected to receive only 2 years of Maintenance Support.

Latest Red Hat JBoss EAP releases are following the long-life product life cycle with 7 years of
support divided in two phases. The first phase, called Full Support, lasts 4 years with
enhancements, bug and security fixes. The second phase, called Maintenance Support, lasts 3
years with bug and security fixes only.

Additional support is available by subscribing to Extended Life Support (ELS). This phase is
divided in two parts: ELS 1 and ELS 2. Critical bug and security fixes are only provided during the
ELS 1 phase.
