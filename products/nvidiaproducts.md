> Nvidia designs <abbr title="Graphics Processing Unit">GPUs</abbr> for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. This page tracks Nvidia GPUs, which provide support for their various GPU lineups and are [available for Windows, Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).

## Naming scheme

- Professional cards include cards under their `NVS`, `Quadro`, `Quadro RTX`, `GRID`, and `Tesla` lineups.
- Consumer cards include their `GeForce` and `Titan` lineups.

## Common misconceptions

There are multiple GPUs with the same name but part of a different architecture (therefore different support status length), and there are other cases to be careful of:

### Desktop:

- `GT730`: Has a `GF108` (Fermi) and a `GK208` (Kepler) variant.
- `GT625`: Has a `GF108` (Fermi) and a `GK107`/`GK208` (Kepler) variant.
- `GT640`: Has a `GF116` (Fermi) and a `GK107`/`GK208` (Kepler) variant.
- `GT645/620` is a Fermi card, even though all other 600 series are Kepler variants (with the exception of the above)
- `GT705` has a `GF119` (Fermi) and a `GK208` (Kepler) variant.
- `GTX745`, `GTX750` and `GTX750 Ti` are Maxwell, even though all other `700` series are Kepler variant (with the exception of the above)
- `GT1030`: Has a `GK107` (Kepler) and a `GP108` (Pascal) variant.
- All-in-one **desktops** are known to feature Mobile GPUs, which would make them fall under a different (and often shorter) support cycle.

### Laptop:

- `GT810M`/`GT820M` are Fermi cards.
- `GT825M`/`GT870M`/`GT880M` are Kepler cards.
- `GT920M` is a Kepler card.
- Most cards in the `800M` series have multiple variant with varying architectures (A card in this series can be Fermi, Kepler or Maxwell).

## Identifying your GPU

Due to this confusing naming scheme, one should not look at just the model name when seeing their support status, but instead their architecture.

### Windows

1. [Download and run GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/).
2. First identify if you have a consumer or a professional card. See the "Naming scheme" section above.
3. Next identify the card architecture. This will be the GPU textbox. You can cross-reference this with the support table at the top of this page.

### Linux

1. Install the `lshw` package from your distribution's repositories.
2. Run the command `sudo lshw -C display`, your GPU code is the `product` column.
3. Next identify the card architecture. This will be the GPU textbox. You can cross-reference this with the support table at the top of this page.

This GPU Code follows a similar pattern for most cards, for example we have `GA102`:

- `G`: This means generation
- `A`: This means it belongs to the **Ampere** generation.

Most GPU codes follow this same pattern, with the exceptions of `TUxxx` which means Turing architecture.

## Driver Support Exceptions

- GKxxx ("Kepler") Desktop GPUs are supported on Windows and Linux via the `R470` [legacy driver series](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5202/kw/kepler%20support) till September 2024.
- Consumer `GF1xx` ("Fermi") GPUs are supported on Linux via the `R390` [legacy driver series](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3142/~/support-timeframes-for-unix-legacy-gpu-releases) till the end of 2022.
- Not all Professional Fermi (`GF1xx`) GPUs are still supported on Windows, see the [official GPU support list](https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/Quadro_Certified/392.67/392.67-win10-quadro-release-notes.pdf) for specific models. On Linux there support is for all Fermi GPUs.
