# The Quarkus team forgot to declare a GitHub release for 2.11.0.
# Tag and Maven release of new minor versions are usually created
# a week before the "official" announcement, hence the use of GitHub releases.

> [Quarkus: Supersonic Subatomic Java](https://quarkus.io/) is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored
> for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards.

The Quarkus team releases a `major.minor` version every 4 to 6 weeks, and a fix version targeting
the latest version every week in between. [Beginning with Quarkus 3.2](https://quarkus.io/blog/lts-releases/),
a new LTS version is also published every 6 months.

Non-LTS minor versions are supported with bug fixes and security updates [until the next minor version](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions/29161). LTS releases are supported for 12 months
with critical bug fixes and security patches.

Red Hat provides a commercial build of Quarkus, [Red Hat build of Quarkus (RHBQ)](https://access.redhat.com/products/quarkus/),
with a longer support timeline. The code base used for this build is the same as the one used for
the community version, but it comes with support, a [slower release cadence](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes#p_quarkus)
and [certified builds of Quarkus and its dependencies](https://code.quarkus.redhat.com/). It
requires a Red Hat subscription to run in production.
