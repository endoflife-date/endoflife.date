> [Hibernate ORM](https://hibernate.org) (or simply Hibernate) is an open-source object–relational mapping tool for the Java programming language.
> It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database.

Hibernate follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
A `{major}.{minor}` combination (6.0, 6.1, 6.2, e.g.) is called a series, and maintenance is based on series.

Series labeled _stable_, usually only the latest, are fully maintained with improvements, bug and security fixes.
Series labeled _limited-support_ [only receive updates that are requested by Red Hat customers](https://discourse.hibernate.org/t/which-version-is-long-term-support-version-for-hibernate-orm-version-5-5-3-or-5-6/9881/3),
and are not guaranteed to be available, except through [their commercial support offering](https://hibernate.org/orm/support/).

Supported series, as well as their support level, are documented on the [Hibernate ORM releases page](https://hibernate.org/orm/releases/).
