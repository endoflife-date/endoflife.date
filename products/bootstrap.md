> [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework
> for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

At times to be determined by the release working group, major versions will be frozen and
transitioned to _Long Term Support_ (LTS). After a determined period of time, versions in Long Term
Support will be deep-frozen and transition to _Maintenance_ (Critical Support).

Versions in _Maintenance_ should not have any changes landed, except for:

- **Critical** bug fixes
- **Critical** security updates
- **Important** documentation updates

Unless a change is urgent, _Maintenance_ releases are likely to be made with minimal frequency.

Bootstrap versions 3 and 4 have reached end of life. Commercial support is available for these versions through the [HeroDevs Never-Ending Support](https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-bootstrap) initiative. For more information, see Bootstrap [3.4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/getting-started/#eol) and [4.6.x](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/end-of-life/) docs.
