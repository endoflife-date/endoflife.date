> [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) is an agent for collecting, processing, aggregating, and writing metrics.
Based on a plugin system to enable developers in the community to easily add support for additional metric collection.

InfluxData will provide Support Services for the current Minor Release (x.Y) of the Software and the immediately preceding Minor Release (x.Y)
of the Software, inclusive of all Maintenance Releases (x.y.Z) included in the respective Minor Release. (By way of example only,
InfluxData releases 1.8 (Major release version 1, Minor release version 8) and several maintenance releases thereafter (1.8.1, 1.8.2 and so forth).
InfluxData then releases a new Minor Release, 1.9 (Major release version 1, Minor release version 9) and several maintenance releases
thereafter (1.9.1, 1.9.2 and so forth). In this example, InfluxData would provide Support Services for 1.8 and 1.9 and all of its respective
maintenance releases).
