> [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash/) is a tool to collect, process, and forward events and
> log messages.

Logstash is part of the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/), also known as the
[ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack). It shares the same support policy as the
other products in the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats...).

Elastic Stack product releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Elastic provides
maintenance for each major release series for the longest of 30 months after the GA date of the
major release or 6 months after the GA date of the subsequent major release.

End of life dates for Logstash can be found on the [Elastic product EOL dates page](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol).
Support for various operating systems can also be found on the [Elastic support matrix page](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix).
