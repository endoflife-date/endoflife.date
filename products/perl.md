> [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 30 years of development.

As detailed in the [perlpolicy](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpolicy#MAINTENANCE-AND-SUPPORT) man page, the Perl community will, to the best of its ability, attempt to:
- Fix critical issues in the two most recent stable 5.x release series.
- Provide critical security patches for any major version of Perl whose 5.x.0 release was within the past three years.
