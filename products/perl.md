> [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 30
> years of development.

Perl used the following policy since the 5.6 release of Perl:

- Maintenance releases (ready for production use) are even numbers, such as 5.8, 5.10, 5.12.
- Development releases are odd numbers, such as 5.9, 5.11, 5.13.

This page only list maintenance releases. Moreover, as detailed in the
[perlpolicy](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpolicy#MAINTENANCE-AND-SUPPORT) man page, the Perl
community will, to the best of its ability, attempt to:

- Fix critical issues in the two most recent maintenance releases.
- Provide critical security patches for any maintenance release within the past three years.
