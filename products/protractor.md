> [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/#/) is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS
> applications. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it
> as a user would.

Protractor was [deprecated](https://www.protractortest.org/#/project-status) on August 31, 2023 after an
[announcement from the Angular team](https://blog.angular.io/the-state-of-end-to-end-testing-with-angular-d175f751cb9c)
was made on August 10, 2022. The Protractor npm package is marked as [deprecated on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor).

Beginning August 1, 2022, [commercial support for Protractor](https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-protractor)
became available for free through a fork of the project maintained by the independent team at
[HeroDevs](https://www.herodevs.com/) which allows you to continue to run your tests in Protractor with full support.

More information is available on the [Protractor website](https://www.protractortest.org/#/).
