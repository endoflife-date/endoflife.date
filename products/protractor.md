> [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/) is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and
> AngularJS applications. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser,
> interacting with it as a user would.

Protractor was [deprecated](https://www.protractortest.org/#/project-status) on August 31, 2023
after an [announcement from the Angular team](https://blog.angular.io/the-state-of-end-to-end-testing-with-angular-d175f751cb9c)
was made on August 10, 2022. The Protractor npm package is also marked as [deprecated on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor).

Beginning August 1, 2022, [commercial support for Protractor](https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-protractor)
became available for free through a fork of the project maintained by the independent team at
[HeroDevs](https://www.herodevs.com/).

More information is available on the [Protractor website](https://www.protractortest.org/).
