> by a large number of independently run nodes, known as instances, each with its own code of
> conduct, terms of service, privacy policy, privacy options, and content moderation policies.

Mastodon follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Its support and EOL policy is not
clearly defined, but supported releases are documented on [its Security Policy page](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/policy).
