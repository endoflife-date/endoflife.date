# Only tracking major releases here, even if regressions are fixed on the last three minors.
# This is because the LTS model is based on major versions, and maintaining so many minor versions
# would be too difficult.

Umbraco follows [Semantic Versioning](https://umbraco.com/products/knowledge-center/versioning-and-release-cadence/).
Starting with Umbraco 9 (2021-09-28), a new major version is released two times per year, a new
minor version is released every 6 weeks, and patch versions are published as soon as possible.

Starting from January 2022, there are two phases of support for major releases: the “Support” phase
and the “Security” phase. The “Support” phase includes bugs, regressions and security fixes for 9
months from the first release, extended to 24 months for LTS major releases. It is followed by the
“Security” phase, which includes only security fixes for 3 months, extended to 12 months for LTS
major releases. At the end of the Security phase, major releases are considered End Of Life (EOL).

A full list of releases with their release notes can be found on
[Umbraco All Releases page](https://our.umbraco.com/download/releases).
