Releases are fully supported for 2 minor versions from initial stable release. During this period,
bugs and security issues that have been reported are fixed and are released during the
[release windows on the first and third Wednesdays of each month](https://www.drupal.org/about/core/policies/core-release-cycles/schedule#windows)
(US time). The final minor release in major release cycle is a long-term support (LTS) release and
has extended security coverage.

**Drupal 7** will receive security coverage [until November 2023](https://www.drupal.org/about/core/policies/core-release-cycles/schedule#drupal-7-eol)
and [limited vendor extended support](https://www.drupal.org/project/d7es). A decision to extend
this further will be taken by July 2023.
