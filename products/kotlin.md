> [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
> Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library,
> but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript
> (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps.
> Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.
