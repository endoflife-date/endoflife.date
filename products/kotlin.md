> [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose
> programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and
> the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference
> allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to
> JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for
> native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps.

Kotlin support policy [is not clearly defined](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/kotlin-support-roadmap/11454).
But usually only the latest version sees active development and [gets bug and security fixes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-evolution.html#dealing-with-compiler-bugs).

## [API Compatibility](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew16.html#supporting-previous-api-versions-for-a-longer-period)

Development is supported for three previous API versions, along with the current stable one.
