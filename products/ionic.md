> [The Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com) is an open source mobile UI toolkit for building
> modern cross-platform mobile apps from a single code base in Angular, React or Vue.

Only the latest version sees active development. The previous release gets critical bug and security
fixes for a limited time, documented on [this page](https://ionicframework.com/docs/reference/support#framework-maintenance-and-support-status)
(usually six months).
