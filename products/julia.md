> [Julia](https://julialang.org) is an open-source programming language designed for technical computing,
> combining the high performance of compiled languages with the flexibility and approachability of dynamic, interpreted ones.

Julia releases minor versions approximately every 4â€“5 months.
Each minor version is supported until the next is released, with patch updates provided as needed, approximately monthly.
Long-Term Support (LTS) versions are selected occasionally from minor releases and are supported for an extended period, receiving critical bug fixes and security updates.

For more details, see the [Julia release process](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/08/release-process/) blog post,
or the summary from the FAQ: [Do I want to use the Stable, LTS, or nightly version of Julia?](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/faq/#Do-I-want-to-use-the-Stable,-LTS,-or-nightly-version-of-Julia?),
as well as the information in the [Downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

Release notes are kept in the `NEWS.md` file in the git tag for each release, with older release notes being added to the `HISTORY.md` file.
The version of [`NEWS.md` in the `master` branch](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/NEWS.md) of the Julia repository
lists the changes that will be included in the next minor version.
