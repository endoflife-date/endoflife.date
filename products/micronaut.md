> [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) is a modern, JVM-based, full-stack framework for building
> modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications.

The Micronaut framework adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).
While its release, support, and end-of-life policies [were previously documented](https://web.archive.org/web/20230703052603/https://micronaut.io/support-schedule/), this information is no longer publicly available.
Recently, it appears that only the latest major release receives new features, bug fixes, and security updates.

Commercial support for the Micronaut Framework is provided by several companies,
which are listed on [the official Micronaut support page](https://micronaut.io/support/).
