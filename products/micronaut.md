> [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) is a modern, JVM-based, full-stack framework for building modular, easily testable
> microservice and serverless applications.

Versions of the Micronaut framework may fall into one of three lifecycle stages:

- Active Development: those versions receive regular updates.
- Active Maintenance: those versions receive limited bug fixes and patches, mostly focused around the resolution of
  critical security advisories.

The Micronaut Foundation offers [commercial support](https://micronaut.io/support/). This typically lasts a few
years after active maintenance ends.
