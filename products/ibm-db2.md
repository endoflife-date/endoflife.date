> [IBM Db2](https://www.ibm.com/products/db2) is a commercial database management system developed by IBM.
> It is designed to store, analyze, and retrieve data efficiently and is widely used in enterprise environments.
> It initially supported the relational model, but was extended to support objectâ€“relational features and non-relational structures like JSON and XML.

Db2 does not follow a fixed schedule or support policy.
Minor releases are supported with bug and security fixes.
[Extended Support](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7008589) is also available for an additional fee.
