> [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) is an open-source, self-hostable online chat service with
> file sharing, search, and integrations. It is designed as an internal chat for organisations and
> companies.

Mattermost backports high-severity or high-impact security fixes to the previous three monthly
releases and to supported [extended support releases (ESR)](https://docs.mattermost.com/upgrade/extended-support-release.html).
A new ESR release is made when a significant number of new features and improvements have been added
to the product, and have had sufficient time to stabilize. A new ESR is released twice a year in
January and July. ESR releases are supported for nine months.

Announcements are published on the [Mattermost Announcements Mailing List](https://eepurl.com/dCKn2P).
