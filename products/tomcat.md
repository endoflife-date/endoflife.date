> Apache Tomcat is an open-source (Apache-2.0 licensed) pure-Java HTTP web server environment. It implements various [Jakarta web specifications][specs], including [JSP][jsp], [Servlets][servlet], and [WebSockets][websockets].

## Stability

Initial releases of a new major version typically process from Alpha, through Beta to Stable over a period of several months. However, the Stable level is only available once the Java specifications the release implements have been finalised. This means a release that in all other respects is considered stable, may still be labelled as Beta if the specifications are not final.

## Lifecycle

Prior major releases have been supported for approximately 10 years. When a release is sunset and moved to End-of-life status, a notice is provided roughly a year in advance.

Generally 3 major versions of Tomcat are concurrently supported. When Tomcat 10.0 was released as stable Tomcat 7 became EOL. 8.5 is expected to become unsupported once Tomcat 11 becomes stable.

## Java Compatibility

Different versions of Apache Tomcat are available for different versions of the specifications, and the Tomcat website has a [table](https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html) documenting which version of the specification is implemented by a given release.

| Tomcat Version | Minimum Java Version |
|----------------|----------------------|
| 10.1           | 11                   |
| 10.0           | 8                    |
| 9              | 8                    |
| 8.5            | 7                    |
| 7.0            | 6                    |
