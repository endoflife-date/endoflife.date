> Apache Tomcat is an open-source (Apache-2.0 licensed) pure-Java HTTP web server environment. It
> implements various [Jakarta web specifications](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-platform),
> including [JSP](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jsp "Jakarta Server Pages"),
> [Servlets](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.servlet "Jakarta Servlet"),
> and [WebSockets](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.websocket "Jakarta WebSocket").

## Stability

Initial releases of a new major version typically process from Alpha, through Beta to Stable over a
period of several months. However, the Stable level is only available once the Java specifications
the release implements have been finalised. This means a release that in all other respects is
considered stable, may still be labelled as Beta if the specifications are not final.

## Lifecycle

Prior major releases have been supported for approximately 10 years. When a release is sunset and
moved to End-of-life status, a notice is provided roughly a year in advance.

Generally 3 major versions of Tomcat are concurrently supported. When Tomcat 10.0 was released as
stable Tomcat 7 became EOL. 8.5 is expected to become unsupported once Tomcat 11 becomes stable.

## Java Compatibility

Different versions of Apache Tomcat are available for different versions of the specifications,
and the Tomcat website has a [table](https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html) documenting which
version of the specification is implemented by a given release.
