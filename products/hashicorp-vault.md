> [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is a tool for securely accessing secrets. It provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

Generally Available (GA) releases of active products are supported for up to two (2) years. Eligible code-fixes and hot-fixes are provided via a new minor release (Z) on top of the latest "major release" branch, for up to two (2) releases from the most current major release. 

A major release is identified by a change in the first (X) or second (Y) digit in the following versioning nomenclature: `Version X.Y.Z.`

Hashicorp uses the same support period and EoL Policy for all its products.
