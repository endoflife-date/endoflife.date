> [Microsoft SharePoint Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SharePoint) is a web-based collaborative
> platform that integrates with Microsoft Office, developed by Microsoft.

Microsoft publishes tables for each release [detailing the build numbers, versions, and
release dates](https://learn.microsoft.com/officeupdates/sharepoint-updates).

The 2013 version was the last to which Service Pack (SP) appeared. As of 2016 onwards, only security
updates are released for the product.
