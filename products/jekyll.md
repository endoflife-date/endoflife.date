> [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes text
> written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can
> tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.

Jekyll follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). It does not have a fixed release policy,
nor a clearly defined support policy. Nevertheless, limited bug fixes and security updates are
always applied to [the version used by GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/versions/) (Currently
`3.9.x`).
