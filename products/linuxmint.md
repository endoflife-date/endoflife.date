>[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) is a community-driven Linux distribution for desktop and laptop computers based on Debian and Ubuntu, bundled with a variety of free and open-source applications.

Linux Mint has its own repositories for Linux Mint specific packages, but relies directly on Ubuntu repositories for the majority of the package base. 

## Cadence

* 19.3 'Tricia' is the last Linux Mint release to support 32-bit systems. 32-bit software support is still supported, following Ubuntu upstream.
* 18.3 'Sylvia' is the last Linux Mint release to support KDE.
