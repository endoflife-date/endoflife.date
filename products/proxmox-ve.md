> [Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE)](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) is an open-source
> software server for virtualization management. It is a hosted hypervisor that can run operating
> systems including Linux and Windows on x64 hardware.

Proxmox VE versions are supported at least as long as the corresponding Debian Version is oldstable.
Proxmox VE uses a rolling release model and using the latest stable version is always recommended.
