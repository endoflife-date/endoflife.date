> [Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE)](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) Proxmox Virtual Environment is an open-source software server for virtualization management. It is a hosted hypervisor that can run operating systems including Linux and Windows on x64 hardware.

Proxmox VE versions are supported at least as long as the corresponding Debian Version is oldstable. Proxmox VE uses a rolling release model and using the latest stable version is always recommended.
