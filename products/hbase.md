> [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) is an open-source non-relational distributed database
> modeled after Google's Bigtable and written in Java. It's useful for random, real-time read/write
> access to Big Data. The project's goal is the hosting of very large tables -- billions of rows X
> millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware.

You must pick a supported release of Hadoop as per the [compatibility matrix](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#hadoop).

No releases are scheduled in advance.
