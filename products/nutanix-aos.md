> [Nutanix AOS](https://www.nutanixbible.com/4a-book-of-aos-architecture.html) is an operating system
> that provides the core functionality leveraged by workloads and services running on the Nutanix platform.

Nutanix AOS versions are designated using the following format: `X.Y.Z.n`,
where `X` is the major version, `Y` is the minor version, `Z` is the maintenance version, and `n` is the patch version.

Since AOS 7.0, Nutanix [transitioned](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/kbs/details?targetId=kA00e000000LIi9CAG)
from the LTS/STS/eSTS release model to a Unified 'NCI Release Model'.
Under this model, major or minor releases are typically made available every 6â€“9 months.
All releases are actively maintained with bug and security fixes for 15 months,
followed by an additional 9 months of troubleshooting with only security fixes.
