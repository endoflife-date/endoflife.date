According to [https://grafana.com](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/release-notes/cadence/) there is a new major
release of Grafana Loki every year, a new minor release every quarter and approximately two patch releases per month.

The support policy is not documented, so it is assumed that only the latest minor release is supported.
