> [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) is a free and open-source framework with an intuitive and extendable way
> to create type-safe, performant and production-grade full-stack web applications and websites with
> Vue.js.

Nuxt follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The roadmap plans for a major release every
year, with an expectation of patch releases every week or so and minor releases every month or so.

Minor and Patch releases should never contain breaking changes except for features marked as
_experimental_.

All supported versions should run on [all currently supported Node.js](/nodejs) releases.

Commercial security support for Nuxt 2 is available through the [HeroDevs Never-Ending Support](https://www.herodevs.com/support) initiative. For more information, see [Nuxt v2](https://v2.nuxt.com/lts) docs.
