[Nuxt release cycle](https://nuxt.com/docs/community/roadmap)
Since January 2023, we've adopted a consistent release cycle for Nuxt 3, following semver.
We aim for major framework releases every year, with an expectation of patch releases every week
or so and minor releases every month or so. They should never contain breaking changes except within options clearly marked as experimental.
