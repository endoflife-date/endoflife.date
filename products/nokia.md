supported for 2 years only). All Nokia smartphones run either [Android One](https://www.android.com/one/)
or [Android Go](https://www.android.com/versions/go-edition/).

Warranty information for a device can be validated at the [Warranty finder](https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_int/support/topics/warranty-finder)
