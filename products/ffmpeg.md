> [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is a free and open-source software project consisting of a suite of
> libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. It is
> the core of software such as VLC, MPV, Blender, Audacity, HandBrake, OBS Studio, and much more.
> Full list of capabilities is found [in their documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html).

FFmpeg follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The support and EOL policy is not clearly
defined but, looking at the releases history, there is at least a `x.y` release every year which is
supported for at least a year with important bug fixes.

## Long Term Support

While several past FFmpeg releases have enjoyed long term support, 5.1 is the first release where
such an intention is made clear at release. [As per the developers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41695542),
the first minor version of every Odd Major version (ODD.1) is planned to be an LTS. Each LTS release is maintained
for a minimum of 3 years.

Note that these releases are intended for distributors and system integrators, not for end users.
Users that wish to compile from source themselves are strongly encouraged to consider using [the
development branch](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

Maintained releases are listed on the [_Download Page_](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#releases)
and unmaintained releases are listed on the [_Old Releases Page_](https://ffmpeg.org/olddownload.html).
