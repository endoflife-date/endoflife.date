> [Matomo](https://matomo.org/), [formerly known as Piwik](https://matomo.org/blog/2018/01/piwik-is-now-matomo/),
> is an open-source analytics platform. It is developed to track and analyze various components of
> digital activities including websites, servers, CMS, and online services.

Matomo only actively supports the latest version with new features, bug fixes, and security updates.
When a new major version is released, the previous major version enters the [Long Term Support
(LTS)](https://matomo.org/blog/2016/01/announcing-long-term-support-in-matomo-the-analytics-platform-for-your-mission-critical-projects/)
phase and only receives critical bug and security fixes for at least 12 months.
