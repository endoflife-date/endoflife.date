> The [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, D, Modula-2, and COBOL
> as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++,...).
> GCC was originally written as the compiler for the GNU operating system. The GNU system was developed to be 100% free software,
> free in the sense that it respects the user's freedom.
