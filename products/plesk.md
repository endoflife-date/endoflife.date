> [Plesk](https://www.plesk.com/) is a proprietary hosting control panel developed by
> [WebPros](https://webpros.com/). It is designed to help IT specialists manage web, DNS, mail and
> other services through a graphical user interface.

In the past (e.g. 12.x > 17.x), Plesk used to release one major version per year.

Starting from 18.x (Obsidian), a new version is released every 6 weeks and supported for 12 weeks,
with hotfixes and security patches.

With 18.x, Plesk [also took the continuous delivery approach](https://www.plesk.com/blog/partners/obsidian-short-releases-automatic-updates/).
It is now recommended to enable automatic updates to keep Plesk secure and to keep having access to
support.
