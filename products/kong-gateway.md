{: .warning }
This page is about the Community Edition of Kong Gateway, which serves as the foundation
of the Enterprise Edition.

Kong Gateway follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
The Community Edition does not have a clearly defined release policy but, looking at the
recent history, minor versions are released every 10 weeks and supported until the next minor
release. Some minor versions are also designated LTS and supported much longer.

Extended support by Kong Inc. is also available with [Kong Gateway Enterprise Edition](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/support-policy/).
With this edition there is 1 year of support for minor versions and 3 years for LTS versions.
This edition also follows a [different versioning scheme](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/support-policy/#semantic-versioning)
with a fourth number called _Enterprise Patch Version_ (`{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}.{ENTERPRISE_PATCH}`).
