> [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and technical standards compliance.

**Postgres recommends that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use.**

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group supports a major version for 5 years after its initial release. After its five year anniversary, a major version will have one last minor release containing any fixes and will be considered end-of-life (EOL) and no longer supported.

The [Release roadmap](https://www.postgresql.org/developer/roadmap/) lists upcoming minor and major releases. If the release team determines that a critical bug or security fix is too important to wait until the regularly scheduled minor release, it may make a release available outside of the minor release roadmap.
