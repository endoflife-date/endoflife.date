> [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org) is a community enterprise operating system designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution now that its downstream partner CentOS has shifted direction. 
 
It is under intensive development by the community. Rocky Linux is led by Gregory Kurtzer, founder of the CentOS project. 

Rocky Linux aims to function as a downstream build as CentOS had done previously, building releases after they have been added by the upstream vendor, not before.
