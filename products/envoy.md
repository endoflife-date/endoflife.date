> [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) is an open-source high performance C++
> distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as
> a communication bus and "universal data plane" designed for large
> microservice "service mesh" architectures. Envoy runs alongside every
> application and abstracts the network by providing common features in a
> platform-agnostic manner.

All stable releases released in the last 12 months are supported with
security, stability fixes, and any other bugfixes deemed worthwhile.

Major releases [happen quarterly on a fixed release schedule](https://bit.ly/envoy-stable-releases)
(the 15th day of each quarter), with an acceptable delay of up to
2 weeks and a hard deadline of 3 weeks.
