> [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution
> based on musl libc and busybox.

There are several releases of Alpine Linux available at the same time. There is no fixed release
cycle but rather a snapshot of edge is taken every 6 months as a release. Stable releases are
supported normally for 2 years. Security fixes beyond that are on request and when patches are
available.

Only the latest release gets bug fixes, prior supported releases only
get security fixes.
