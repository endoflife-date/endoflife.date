> [SUSE Multi-Linux Manager](https://www.suse.com/products/multi-linux-manager/), formerly known as SUSE Manager, is an open source infrastructure management solution designed to simplify and secure a mixed Linux environment.
> It uses the Salt configuration management system to manage clients, deploy patches and packages, and report changes at scale.

{: .warning }

> This page tracks SUSE Multi-Linux Manager, which is a SUSE product based on the [open-source Uyuni project](https://uyuni-project.org).
> Uyuni offers the same functionality but follows a rolling release â€” bugfixes are only available on the latest version.

SUSE Multi-Linux Manager is usually released every 12 months.
The current release is usually supported for an additional 12 months once after the next release, resulting in a 24-month support cycle.
SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Proxy follows the same lifecycle as SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Server.
