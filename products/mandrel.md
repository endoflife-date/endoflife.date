> Mandrel is [a downstream distribution of the GraalVM community edition](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/05/mandrel-a-community-distribution-of-graalvm-for-the-red-hat-build-of-quarkus/).
> Mandrel's main goal is to provide a `native-image` release specifically to support [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io). The
> aim is to align the `native-image` capabilities from GraalVM with OpenJDK and Red Hat Enterprise Linux libraries to
> improve maintainability for native Quarkus applications. Mandrel can best be described as a distribution of a regular
> OpenJDK with a specially packaged GraalVM Native Image builder (`native-image`).

Mandrel follows [the GraalVM Community release cadence](https://www.graalvm.org/release-calendar/) in principle, but
extends the maintenance window for long term JDK releases.

That is, starting with JDK 20 in June 2023, Mandrel follows the JDKâ€™s six-month release cadence and only supports the
latest JDK version and (at least) the latest LTS JDK version as listed in [JDK Releases](https://www.java.com/releases/).
In some cases and depending on the needs of Quarkus, Mandrel may support the two most recent LTS JDK versions to ease
transition to the latest LTS.

Mandrel is released using the old internal version of GraalVM and will align with JDK's release numbering scheme with
the 25.0 release in September 2025.
