> Oracle Application Express (also known as APEX) is an enterprise low-code application 
> development platform from Oracle Corporation. APEX is used for developing and deploying cloud
>, mobile and desktop applications. The platform is a web - based integrated development
> environment (IDE) with a range of features including wizards, drag-and-drop layout and property
> editors to simplify the process of building applications and pages.

According to the [Roadmap](https://apex.oracle.com/sod), there are two major releases per year.
Patches are not delivered as patch releases; instead, Oracle provides
[Patch Set Bundles](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/apex-downloads/) that can be applied
to the current release.

The version and patch policy can be found from these resources:

- [Release Notes](https://apex.oracle.com/en/learn/documentation/release-notes/)
- [Lifetime Support Policy: Oracle Technology Products (PDF)](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/resources.html)
