> Oracle Application Express (also known as APEX) is an enterprise low-code application
> development platform from Oracle Corporation. APEX is used for developing and deploying cloud,
>mobile and desktop applications. The platform is a web - based integrated development
> environment (IDE) with a range of features including wizards, drag-and-drop layout and property
> editors to simplify the process of building applications and pages.

Oracle APEX is a no-cost option for Oracle Database and has two major releases each year covered under
the Oracle Database maintenance agreement. Each release receives 1.5 years of support. Instead
of individual patch releases, Oracle provides cumulative
[Patch Set Bundles](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/apex-downloads/), which require a "My
Oracle Support" account for download. The latest patches can be re-applied to the current
installation, and announcements for new patches are made on
[APEX's X account](https://twitter.com/OracleAPEX). For details on bug fixes for the current
release, visit the [Known Issues](http://apex.oracle.com/known-issues) page.

Support timeframes for versions < 19.1 are available in the [Lifetime Support Policy: Oracle
Technology Products (PDF)](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/resources.html).
The [Roadmap](https://apex.oracle.com/sod) reveals planned features and explains release plans and
naming convention.
