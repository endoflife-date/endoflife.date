> [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to
> drive processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each
> other. The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java applications. Ant supplies a number of
> built-in tasks allowing to compile, assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant can also be
> used effectively to build non Java applications, for instance C or C++ applications. More
> generally, Ant can be used to pilot any type of process which can be described in terms of
> targets and tasks.
