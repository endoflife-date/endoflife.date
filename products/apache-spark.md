> [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a multi-language engine for executing data
> engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.

Apache Spark follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Minor releases happen roughly every
6 months and are maintained with bug and security fixes for a period of 18 months.

The last minor release within a major release will typically be maintained for longer as an LTS
release. For example, 2.4 was released in November 2nd 2018 and have been maintained for 31 months.
