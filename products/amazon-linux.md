> [Amazon Linux][al2] is a Linux server operating system from Amazon Web Services (AWS) available as
> an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for use on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
> ([Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)). It is also available as a
> [Docker container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/amazonlinux/) and as a
> [virtual machine image](https://cdn.amazonlinux.com/os-images/latest/) for use on Kernel-based
> Virtual Machine (KVM), Oracle VM VirtualBox, Microsoft Hyper-V, and VMware ESXi.

The original [Amazon Linux AMI][al1] is now in a [maintenance support phase][al1-eol] with
[a limited set of packages](https://amazonlinux.github.io/al1-support-statements/) still being
supported. The [Amazon Linux AMI FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/faqs/) has a few more
details.

[Amazon Linux 2][al2] will provide _security updates and bug fixes for all packages in core until
June 30, 2023_. User-space Application Binary Interface (ABI) compatibility is guaranteed for
[specific packages][al2-faq].

## Amazon Linux 2022

AWS announced [Amazon Linux 2022](https://aws.amazon.com/linux/amazon-linux-2022/) as a successor to
Amazon Linux 2, which uses Fedora as the upstream and is currently in preview. Starting with AL2022,
a new major version of Amazon Linux releases every two years, includes minor quarterly releases, and
comes with five years of long-term support. Every major version release will be supported under
active development for 2 years, followed by a maintenance phase of 3 years.

Amazon Provides security advisories for all versions on the Amazon Linux Security Center.
