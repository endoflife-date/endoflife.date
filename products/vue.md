> [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex.

[Vue does not have a fixed release cycle](https://vuejs.org/about/releases.html). Patch releases are released as needed. Minor releases always contain new features, with a typical time frame of 3~6 months in between. Minor releases always go through a beta pre-release phase. Major releases will be announced ahead of time, and will go through an early discussion phase and alpha / beta pre-release phases.
