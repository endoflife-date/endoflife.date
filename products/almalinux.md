> [AlmaLinux OS](https://almalinux.org/) is an open Source, community owned and governed, forever-free enterprise Linux distribution, focused on long-term stability, providing a robust production-grade platform. AlmaLinux OS is 1:1 binary compatible with [RHEL速](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) and pre-Stream [CentOS](https://centos.org/).

AlmaLinux OS fills the gap left by the discontinuation of the CentOS Linux stable release. AlmaLinux OS is a 1:1 binary compatible clone of RHEL速 guided and built by the community.

As a standalone, completely free OS, AlmaLinux OS enjoys $1M in annual sponsorship from CloudLinux Inc and support from other sponsors. Ongoing development efforts are governed by the members of the community.

The AlmaLinux OS Foundation is a 501(c)(6) non-profit created for the benefit of the AlmaLinux OS community.

For a comparison against other Enterprise Linux (EL) distributions, see [the table on the wiki](https://wiki.almalinux.org/Comparison.html).

AlmaLinux OS attempts to release regular updates within 1 business day from RHEL速.  The latest minor release goal is 3 days.  Each release, like RHEL, comes with a 10 year lifecycle.  Major releases take quite a bit longer to ready for release as significant effort is required to re-brand all packages and metadata, and are typically available within a few weeks to a few months following a major RHEL release.

If you need paid support, there is 3rd party support for AlmaLinux available.  You may also consider purchasing [Red Hat Enterprise Linux速](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) (which comes with great support), without which making AlmaLinux would not be possible.
