> [AlmaLinux OS](https://almalinux.org/) is an open Source, community owned and governed, forever-free enterprise Linux distribution, focused on long-term stability, providing a robust production-grade platform. AlmaLinux OS is 1:1 binary compatible with [RHELÂ®](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) and pre-Stream [CentOS](https://centos.org/).

AlmaLinux OS attempts to release regular updates within 1 business day from RHEL.  Each release, like RHEL, comes with a 10-year lifecycle.  Major releases are typically available within a few weeks to a few months following a major RHEL release.
