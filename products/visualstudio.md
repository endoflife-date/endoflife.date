> [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) is a full-featured IDE to code, debug, test, and deploy to any platform  

The Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) enables teams to remain supported on a minor version for up to 18 months after release. The LTSC are separate release Channels based on the even-numbered minor version updates. An LTSC release receives security and bug fixes but not additional new features.

**Visual Studio 2019** follows the Microsoft Product Fixed Lifecycle Policy of 10 years. The first 5 years of Mainstream Support provide feature updates, platform updates, security updates, and functionality fixes, and the second 5 years of Extended support provide security updates. For more information, search the Support Lifecycle Database.

**Visual Studio 2017** and earlier are also supported for 10 years

The **Visual Studio Community edition** is only supported on the recommended latest release of the latest minor version of Visual Studio.
