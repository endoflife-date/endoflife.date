> It is a commercially supported and certified version of the open-source WildFly application server.
> JBoss EAP provides a platform for developing and deploying enterprise-level Java applications.

> JBoss EAP includes various features such as support for multiple programming models, such as Servlets, JSP, EJB, JMS,
> and others, and is compatible with multiple databases, messaging systems, and web frameworks.


## Full Support Phase

Start Date: General Availability

Full support is provided according to the published Scope of Coverage and Service Level Agreement.
Likewise, Development Support is provided according to the published Scope of Coverage and Service Level
Agreement.
All available and qualified patches will be applied via periodic product updates and CPs, or
as required for qualified security patches.

## Maintenance Support Phase

Start Date: no less than one (1) year after General Availability.

Production support is provided according to the published Scope of Coverage and Service Level Agreement. Likewise,
Development Support is provided according to the published Scope of Coverage and Service Level Agreement. During
the maintenance phase, qualified security patches of Critical or Important impact, as well as select
mission-critical bug-fix patches, will be released.

## Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS)

[Compare Life Cycle Phases](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes#phase_compare)

Extended Life support is provided according to the published Scope of Coverage and Service Level
Agreement. Unlike our Full Support and Maintenance Support phases, this support phase requires an ELS
subscription in addition to a supported product’s base subscription. Extended Life Support subscriptions
of Red Hat Application Services products provide decreasing support and maintenance over time as described below.

**Troubleshooting for Application Services product releases in the ELS Life Cycle Phase is limited to the latest minor release.**

**Container distributions of Application Services products in the ELS Life Cycle Phase will be marked "Deprecated" in the Red Hat Container Catalog.**

See the article [Deprecation of Red Hat Runtimes product container images in the Red Hat Container Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6200982) for more detail.

### ELS-1

[Compare Life Cycle Phases](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes#phase_compare)

### ELS-2

[Compare Life Cycle Phases](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes#phase_compare)

ELS-2 support is offered after the end of the ELS-1. ELS-2 provides limited ongoing technical support to
include: Advice and guidance for migrating to current product releases, problem evaluation and workarounds.
Bug fixes, security fixes, hardware enablement or root-cause analysis (other than to determine possible
workarounds) are not available during this phase, and support is limited to existing installations only.

The duration of ELS-2 support is scheduled for 3 years and may be extended on a product-by-product basis.
Red Hat reserves the right to terminate the ongoing support in the ELS-2 for a particular product at any
time beyond the initial 3 year period.

## Life Cycle Phase Comparison Table

See [dedicated table](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes#p_eap): 

## Life Cycle Duration

Red Hat Application Services product life cycles are generally three, five, or seven years in length as described below.

### Long-life Product Life Cycle

A Long-life Product Life Cycle of seven years is generally applied to foundation products, such at Red Hat JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform. As depicted below, the seven-year cycle includes four years of Full Support and
three years of Maintenance Support.

Extensions beyond the seventh year (“Extended Life Support”) are available under a separate subscription, scope of coverage, and SLA.

### Standard Product Life Cycle

A Standard Product Life Cycle of five years applies to most Red Hat Application Services products.
The Standard Product Life Cycle is also composed of two phases, Full Support and Maintenance Support.
Extensions beyond the fifth year (“Extended Life Support”) are available under a separate subscription,
scope of coverage, and SLA.

### Limited Product Life Cycle

The Limited Product Life Cycle of three years is generally applied to newer product areas and rapidly changing
technologies such as development frameworks. The Limited Product Life Cycle is only composed of one phase, the Full
Support Phase, however, variations may include a Maintenance Phase for some product releases. Extensions beyond the
third year (“Extended Life Support”) are available under a separate subscription, scope of coverage, and SLA.

## Archived JBoss Product Life Cycle Information 

 Life cycle dates for product releases that have reached their end of support life can be found on the
 [Archived JBoss Product Life Cycle Information page](https://access.redhat.com/site/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes/eol/).
