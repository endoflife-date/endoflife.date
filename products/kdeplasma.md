> [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) is a graphical desktop environment with customizable layouts and panels, supporting virtual desktops and widgets. It is available on most Linux distributions and FreeBSD.

KDE Plasma releases roughly three major feature releases a year, with one Long Term Support release every other year. There is a [detailed schedule](https://community.kde.org/Schedules/Plasma_5) for future bug fix releases and major releases. 

## Release Cadence
* Plasma 5.24 (LTS) bug fix support will end once the first Plasma 6.0 feature release comes out.
* Bugfix tags/releases are made on Tuesdays in a [Fibonacci sequence of weeks](https://community.kde.org/Schedules/Plasma_5#Bugfix_versions) (1, 1, 2, 3, 5) after each previous release of the same series.
