> [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) is a graphical desktop environment with customizable
> layouts and panels, supporting virtual desktops and widgets. It is available on most Linux
> distributions and FreeBSD.

KDE Plasma releases roughly three major feature releases a year, with one Long Term Support release
every other year. There is a [detailed schedule](https://community.kde.org/Schedules/Plasma_6) for
future bug fix releases and major releases.

## Release Cadence

* The last Plasma 5 release will be version 5.27 LTS and the end of critical bug
  fixes is not yet announced.
* Bugfix tags/releases are made on Tuesdays in a [Fibonacci sequence of weeks](https://community.kde.org/Schedules/Plasma_6#Releases_Cycle)
  (1, 1, 2, 3, 5) after each previous release of the same series.
