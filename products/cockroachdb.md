> [CockroachDB](http://cockroachdb.com/) is a distributed SQL database built on a transactional and
> strongly-consistent key-value store, developed by Cockroach Labs.

{: .warning }
> This page tracks the CockroachDB Self-Hosted releases - the Cloud and Serverless releases have their own
> [support and upgrade policy](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy).

CockroachDB follows a three-component [calendar versioning scheme](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/#release-naming).
A major version of CockroachDB is released once per quarter, alternating between
a Regular release or an Innovation release. New releases are made available for CockroachDB Cloud clusters
for two weeks before binaries are published for Self-Hosted downloads.

- **Regular (GA)** Releases offer 1 year of Maintenance Support, followed by 6 months of Assistance Support.
  Regular Releases since v23.1 can upgrade to become an LTS Release after they demonstrate a continuously high
  level of stability and performance.
- **Long Term Support(LTS)** Releases offer 1 year of Maintenance Support from the date of the first LTS
  patch release, followed by 1 year of Assistance Support.
- **Innovation** offer 6 months of Maintenance Support. They do not have LTS releases. 

## Support Levels

Each release cycle can be in one of two support levels:

- **Maintenance** Support: The release is actively supported with bug and security fixes.
- **Assistance** Support: The release is supported with critical security fixes only.

## Reference

- A list of all [Production Releases](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases#production-releases) includes
  the first LTS release in each release cycle.
