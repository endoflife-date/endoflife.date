> [SonarQube Community Build](https://www.sonarsource.com/open-source-editions/sonarqube-community-edition/) is a free and open-source version of the SonarQube platform,
> offering continuous inspection of code quality to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells across various programming languages.

{: .note }

> SonarQube Community Build [used to be called SonarQube Community Edition until end of 2024](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/updates-to-sonar-s-community-functionality/130732).
> It followed the same versioning scheme as the commercial versions.
> Since version 24.12.0.100206, releases of SonarQube Community Build and the commercial offering Sonarqube Server do not align
> and there is no mapping between the versions of SonarQube Community Build and [SonarQube Server](/sonarqube-server).

SonarQube Community Build releases follow the following calendar version scheme: `YY.M.0.BuildNumber`,
with `YY` being the year of the release, `M` being the month of the release, and `BuildNumber` being the internal build number.

A new version of SonarQube Community Build is released every month.
There is no active version or Long-Term Active (LTA) version concepts for SonarQube Community Build,
meaning bug and security issues won't be fixed until the next Community Build version.

New releases are announced on the [community.sonarsource.com](https://community.sonarsource.com/c/sq/releases/24).
