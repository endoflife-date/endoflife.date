> [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) is a scalable datastore for metrics, events, and real-time analytics.

{: .warning }

> This page is focusing on the commercial self-hosted version of InfluxDB, currently named InfluxDB Enterprise.

InfluxDB does use a versioning format that resembles [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
The last two minor releases are supported with bug and security fixes.

When a new major release is made, the last minor of the previous major is supported for at least 12 months.
As of 2 August 2025:

- InfluxDB 1 is [still supported for paying customers](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/25045#issuecomment-2153063103)
  (see also, [release notes for version 1](https://docs.influxdata.com/enterprise_influxdb/v1/about-the-project/release-notes/)),
- InfluxDB 2 is [not planned to be EOL'd](https://community.influxdata.com/t/questions-about-influxdb-3-enterprise-free-tier-for-home-users-and-the-future-of-influxdb-v2/57028)
  (see also, [release notes for version 2](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/reference/release-notes/influxdb/)).

There is no documented support policy for InfluxDB OSS/Core.
However, it's likely the OSS/Core support is similar to the commercial support.

Note that starting with InfluxDB 3, the OSS version became known as [InfluxDB 3 Core](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/influxdb-3-oss-ga/).
InfluxDB 3 Core [is not a replacement for InfluxDB OSS v1 and v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfluxDB#InfluxDB_3_changes_open_source_offerings).
