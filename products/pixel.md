> Pixel is Google's current line of Android phones and other consumer electronics.

In recent years, flagship Pixel phones have been released in October each year, followed by an
additional mid-range variant known as the 'A-series' several months later. Pixel phones are
supported with guaranteed software updates for three years.

Starting with the Pixel 6, Google has committed to at least five years of security updates,
extending an additional two years beyond the 3-year Android version update commitment. The end date
for guaranteed Android version updates is indicated in the 'Active Support' column.
