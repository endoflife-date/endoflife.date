> Pixel is Google's current line of Android phones and other consumer electronics.

In recent years, flagship Pixel phones have been released in October each year, followed by an
additional mid-range variant known as the 'A-series' several months later. Since the introduction
of the Pixel 6 in 2021, Pixel phones have been supported with guaranteed Android version updates
for three years and security updates for five years.

In October 2023, it was
[announced](https://blog.google/products/pixel/software-support-pixel-8-pixel-8-pro/) that the
Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro will guarantee both Android version updates and security updates for
seven years, offering full support until October 2030.

The end date for guaranteed Android version updates is indicated in the 'Active Support' column.
