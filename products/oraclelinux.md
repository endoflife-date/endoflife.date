> [Oracle Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/) is an Open Source, free RHEL derivative developed by Oracle to be 100% application binary compatible alternative to Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## Differences with Upstream RHEL:

 - Unlike RHEL, [Oracle Linux does not support point releases once a newer one is available.](https://community.oracle.com/tech/apps-infra/discussion/4481998/what-is-the-lifecycle-of-oracle-linux-for-minor-releases) Once a new minor point release is available, the older one is immediately considered end of life and users must upgrade to continue receiving security updates. For example once 8.5 gets a general release, 8.4 is immediately end of life. Whereas on RHEL [this is not the case.](https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-eus)
 - Oracle Linux offers different support periods than upstream RHEL, with extra fees for using extended support which is explained [here](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/oracle-linux-extended-support-oct2020.pdf)
 - By default, Oracle Linux does not use the same kernel upstream RHEL uses, instead they support their own kernel builds called [UEK](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/uek/) which may not be compatible with upstream kernels. [There is a Red Hat Compatible Kernel (RHCK) available as an alternative.](https://community.oracle.com/tech/apps-infra/discussion/4467791/oracle-linux-how-to-change-default-kernel)
