> [etcd](https://etcd.io) is an open-source, strongly consistent and distributed
> key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be
> accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It is used as the
> backing store by [Kubernetes](/kubernetes).

etcd follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Backwards-compatible bugs are
fixed for the latest two stable releases. A patch release to each supported
release branch, incorporating any bug fixes, happens every two weeks.

The list of currently maintained releases is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/contributor-guide/release.md#release-management).
