> [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) is a web-based code
> review tool built on JGit.

The Gerrit open-source community actively supports the last 3 releases on a best effort
basis. Older releases are not actively maintained but may still receive
important fixes (e.g. security fixes), but there is no guarantee for this.

End-of-life for old releases happens implicitly when a new Gerrit version is
released, and is announced via the [project news](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/news.html)
and on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/repo-discuss).
