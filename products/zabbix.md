> [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/) is an open-source software tool to monitor IT infrastructure such as networks, servers, virtual machines, and cloud services.

A LTS (Long Term Support) release is made once every 1.5 years. Standard releases are made once every 6 months.

LTS releases get 3 years of full support followed by 2 years of limited support (critical and security issues only).

Standard releases get 6 months of full support until the next stable release, followed by 1 month of limited support (critical and security issues only).
