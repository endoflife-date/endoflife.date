> [Apache Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) is a Java-based logging utility. It is part of the Apache Logging Services, a project of the Apache Software Foundation.

Log4j 1 reached End-Of-Life on [August 2015](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache_logging_services_project_announces). The [reload4j](https://reload4j.qos.ch/) project provides a drop-in replacement for Log4j 1.x with maintenance and security fixes.

## Java Support

The only supported Java version is Java 8 and above.

- Log4j 2.13.0 and greater require Java 8.
- Log4j (2.4 - 2.12.2) require Java 7.
- Log4j 2.12.2 was released as an emergency release (to fix CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-44228) and is the last 2.x release to support Java 7. The Log4j team no longer supports Java 7, so this release (while fixing the vulnerability) is no longer supported.
- Log4j 2.3 was the last 2.x release to support Java 6.
