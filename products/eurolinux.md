> [EuroLinux](https://euro-linux.com) is a Polish Enterprise-class Linux distribution that has been in development since 2013. EuroLinux is built upon the foundation of Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® source code. This guarantees its compatibility with [RHEL®](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux), [Oracle® Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/), [CentOS](https://centos.org/), as well as new, recently published community distributions [AlmaLinux](https://almalinux.org/) and [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/). EuroLinux offers the same operating environment of software designed for these systems, and provides the same hardware certification. The system is maintained and developed by experienced architects and developers. It is available in two versions: paid and free. The paid version provides additional technical support cover.

EuroLinux releases regular updates within 1 business day from RHEL®. Each release, like RHEL®, comes with a 10 year lifecycle.
