> [MongoDB Server](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a general purpose, document-based, distributed
> database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.

with all GA Major Releases of the MongoDB Server that are released on or within five years of the
Release Date of that version of the Stable API. Lifecycle Schedule is documented at
<https://www.mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles>.

Extended support by MongoDB for up to 2 years is available through the commercial
