> [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/) is a full stack framework dedicated to API-driven projects and implementing the Jamstack architecture.

Releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). A new minor version is released every six months, and a new major version every two years along with a minor version that brings an upgrade path. Besides the development branch, two versions are maintained:

- the latest version is actively supported with regular bug fixes;
- the previous version is supported for security maintenance only.

Versions older than the latest two are not maintained.
