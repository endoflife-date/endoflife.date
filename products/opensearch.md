> [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) is a community-driven, Apache 2.0-licensed open source search and analytics suite that makes it easy to ingest, search, visualize, and analyze data. Developers build with OpenSearch for use cases such as application search, log analytics, data observability, data ingestion, and more.

## Versioning

OpenSearch only releases breaking changes in major versions. All minor versions are compatible with every other minor version for that major release. When new major versions are released the previous major version enters a maintenance window â€“ during the maintenance window, the software will continue to receive bug fixes and security patches, but no new features.

The duration of the maintenance window will vary from release to release. By default, versions will remain under maintenance until the next major version enters maintenance, or 1 year passes, whichever is longer.

## Elasticsearch Compatibility

OpenSearch is a fork of Elasticsearch 7.10 and maintains backwards compatibility with the Elasticsearch APIs for ingest, search, and management. OpenSearch indices are backwards compatible with Elasticsearch indices from versions 6.0 up to 7.10. While the OpenSearch API is backwards compatible, some clients or tools may include code, such as version checks, that may cause the client or tool to not work with OpenSearch. An [Upgrade Guide](https://opensearch.org/faq/#q3.1) is available. All future OpenSearch 1.x releases will be backwards compatible with Elasticsearch 7.10.

- [Compatibility Matrices](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/agents-and-ingestion-tools/index/#compatibility-matrices) are provided for compatibility with Beats and Logstash. Beats version >= 7.13 does not support OpenSearch.
