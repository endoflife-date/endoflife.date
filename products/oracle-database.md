## Product description

> Oracle Database is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed
> by Oracle Corporation.

> It is widely used in enterprise environments for managing large amounts of structured data,
>such as financial information, customer data, and inventory management.

> Oracle Database uses the Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation and
> management, and it provides advanced features such as robust security, transactional
> consistency, and high availability. Additionally, Oracle Database offers a wide range
> of tools and technologies for data warehousing, business intelligence, and application 
> development, making it a versatile and powerful platform for businesses of all sizes.

## Oracle Lifetime Support Policy

> The "Lifetime Support Policy" provides access to technical experts for as long as
> you license your Oracle products.
> It consists of three support stages: Premier Support, Extended Support, and Sustaining Support.

## Premier Support

> Premier Support provides you with maintenance and support for your Oracle Database
> products for five years from their general availability date
  
## Extended Support
  
> Extended Support lets you stay competitive, with the freedom to upgrade on your
> timetable. If you take advantage of Extended Support, it provides you with
> an extra three years of support for specific Oracle releases for an additional fee.

## Sustaining Support
  
> Sustaining Support puts you in control of your upgrade strategy. When Premier Support expires, if you choose
> not to purchase Extended Support, or when Extended Support expires, Sustaining Support will be available for
> as long as you license your Oracle products. With Sustaining Support, you receive technical support, including
> access to our online support tools, knowledgebases, and technical support experts.
