> Oracle Database is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle Corporation.

Oracle Database uses the Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation and 
management, and it provides features such as robust security, transactional
consistency, and high availability. 

## Oracle Lifetime Support Policy

The "Lifetime Support Policy" provides access to technical experts for as long as
the Oracle products licence lasts..
It consists of three support stages: Premier Support, Extended Support, and Sustaining Support.

## Premier Support

Premier Support provides maintenance and support for five years from the general
availability date of a given release.
  
## Extended Support
  
Extended Support lets upgrade on a chosen timetable. It provides an extra three years
of support for specific Oracle releases for an additional fee.

## Sustaining Support
  
Sustaining Support puts people in control of your upgrade strategy.
When Premier Support expires, if one choose not to purchase Extended Support, or when
Extended Support expires,
Sustaining Support will be available for as long as the Oracle products lasts.
With Sustaining Support, there is technical support, including access to online support
tools, knowledgebases, and technical support experts.
