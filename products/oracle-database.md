## Oracle Lifetime Support Policy

> With Oracle Support, you know up front and with certainty how long your Oracle products are supported. The
> Lifetime Support Policy provides access to technical experts for as long as you license your Oracle products and
> consists of three support stages: Premier Support, Extended Support, and Sustaining Support. It delivers
> maximum value by providing you with rights to major product releases so you can take full advantage of
> technology and product enhancements. Your technology and your business keep moving forward together.

## Premier Support

> Premier Support provides you with maintenance and support for your Oracle Database
> products for five years from their general availability date
  
## Extended Support
  
> Extended Support lets you stay competitive, with the freedom to upgrade on your
> timetable. If you take advantage of Extended Support, it provides you with
> an extra three years of support for specific Oracle releases for an additional fee.

## Sustaining Support
  
> Sustaining Support puts you in control of your upgrade strategy. When Premier Support expires, if you choose
> not to purchase Extended Support, or when Extended Support expires, Sustaining Support will be available for
> as long as you license your Oracle products. With Sustaining Support, you receive technical support, including
> access to our online support tools, knowledgebases, and technical support experts.
