> [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) is an open source framework for message-oriented
> middleware with a rule-based routing and mediation engine. It provides a Java object-based
> implementation of the Enterprise Integration Patterns using an application programming interface
> (or declarative Java domain-specific language) to configure routing and mediation rules.

Apache Camel follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). There are two LTS releases per year,
and they are supported for one year with security and important/critical bug fixes. Non-LTS releases
[don't receive any support](https://camel.apache.org/blog/2020/03/LTS-Release-Schedule/).

A list of known CVEs is available [on the security information page](https://camel.apache.org/security/).
