Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 is available in two editions: Community (free) and Enterprise (paid).
This page only covers the Enterprise edition.

Support for Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 requires an active maintenance contract and is divided
into two phases.

The first phase ends with the end of fix date. During this phase, updates, patches, and hotfixes
are provided for the product.

The second phase ends with the end of support date. Updates, patches, and hotfixes may also be
provided during this phase, but on a case-by-case basis. If Veeam determines that an issue is fixed
in a later supported generally available version, an update to the later release is required.
