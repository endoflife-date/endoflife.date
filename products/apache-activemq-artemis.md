> [Apache ActiveMQ Artemis](https://activemq.apache.org/) is an open source Java-based message
> broker that supports a number of transport protocols, such as STOMP, MQTT, or AMQP.

There are currently two flavors of ActiveMQ available â€” the _"Classic"_ broker, and the next
generation broker code-named _Artemis_ (which will become the next "Classic" major version at some
point).  
This page tracks ActiveMQ "Artemis" releases; information about the classic version can be found in
its own [product page](/apache-activemq).

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis does not have a clearly defined release and support policy. It seems that
only the latest minor release is actively maintained.

The full list of versions, with their associated release notes, is available [in the Apache ActiveMQ
Artemis documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/versions.html).
