> [Istio](https://www.istio.io/) is a service mesh that extends Kubernetes to establish a
> programmable, application-aware network using the Envoy service proxy. Working with both
> Kubernetes and traditional workloads, Istio brings standard, universal traffic management,
> telemetry, and security to complex deployments.

Istio follows [Semantic Versioning](https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/#naming-scheme).
A new minor version is released approximately once a quarter. Minor releases are supported for 6
weeks after the N+2 minor release (for example 1.14 supported until 6 weeks after 1.16.0 is
released).
