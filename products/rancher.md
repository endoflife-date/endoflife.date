> [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) is a complete software stack for teams adopting containers.
> It addresses the operational and security challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters,
> while providing DevOps teams with integrated tools for running containerized workloads.

Rancher does not have a fixed release and support policy, but End Of Maintenance (EOM) and End of
Life (EOL) dates for each release are well documented [on their website](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle#rancher).

Looking at the latest releases, it seems that all releases are fully supported for at least 1 year
with bug and security fixes, followed by at least 6 months of limited support with critical
security fixes only.

Compatibility with various Kubernetes distributions can be found on [the rancher support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/).
