> AngularJS is a free and open-source JavaScript-based web framework for developing single-page
> applications. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by
> providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel
> (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in web applications and progressive
> web applications. AngularJS, referred to as Angular 1, was built and maintained by Google.

AngularJS was [deprecated](https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/version-support-status) on
December 31, 2021 after a [LTS period](https://blog.angular.io/stable-angularjs-and-long-term-support-7e077635ee9c)
on the final version 1.8.3 which was released April 7, 2022.

Beginning January 1, 2022, [extended long term support for AngularJS](https://xlts.dev/angularjs)
became available for 1.5.x and 1.8.x versions through a fork of the project maintained by the
independent team at [XLTS.dev](http://xlts.dev/).
