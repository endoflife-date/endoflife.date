> The [Samsung Galaxy Watch](https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/) series is a line of smartwatches designed and produced
> by Samsung Electronics.

{: .note}
Some release dates may vary depending on the country or region.
Most Android upgrades or security update dates are approximate to the year.

Samsung Galaxy Watch devices have two levels of support: Wear OS upgrades and security updates.

Wear OS upgrades refer to updates that provide a device with newer major releases of the Wear OS operating system.
These upgrades typically include new features, improvements to performance and security, and enhancements to the user interface.
Wear OS upgrades ensure that devices remain compatible with the latest apps and benefit from ongoing development by Google and Samsung.

Security updates refer to updates that address vulnerabilities and security issues in the Wear OS operating system. They
are essential for maintaining the security and privacy of a device, and may occur monthly, quarterly, or biannually
depending on the model and its age.

Guaranteed Wear OS upgrades are provided for a limited period, which is usually less (but never more) than the device's security update period.
How many Wear OS upgrades a device receives depends on the model.
However, since Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung Galaxy Watches have been supported [for five years](https://www.knowyourmobile.com/phones/samsung/one-ui/samsung-update-policy/#Samsung_Update_Policy_For_Galaxy_Watches)
â€“ four Android version updates and five years of security patches.
