# Setting a layout forces Jekyll to render this file

The following loop creates a _redirects file as per
Netlify's syntax: https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/

This also creates a lot of whitespace in the resulting file.

To create a new redirect, add a alternate_urls array in the page front-matter.

The _redirects file is included in _config.yml/include key otherwise
Jekyll doesn't copy it to _site directory, where Netlify expects it.

{% endcomment %}
{% for page in site.pages %}

	{% if page.alternate_urls %}

# Redirects for {{page.path}}
		{% for url in page.alternate_urls %}

{{page.permalink}}					{{url}}

		{% endfor %}

	{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
