>[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby.

Only the latest Rails version gets bug fixes, and the version before that gets security fixes. Severe security issues (as judged by the core team) are backported further; e.g., v4.2.11.1 and v5.0.7.2 are [severe security fixes](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2019/3/13/Rails-4-2-5-1-5-1-6-2-have-been-released/) that were created after v4.2 and v5.0 were no longer receiving (non-severe) security updates.

A complete list of historic versions is available on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails/versions). New releases are published on the [Rails blog](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/releases/).
