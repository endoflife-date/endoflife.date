# HACKING

endoflife.date uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the static website generator. This document helps you set the codebase locally. This isn't necessary for most content changes. Follow this guide if you are making layout, design, or code changes.

## Development

First, you will need to install Ruby and Bundler. Follow [these instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) to install Ruby, and then run the following commands:

```
# Install bundler
gem install bundler
# Clone the project:
git clone git@github.com:endoflife-date/endoflife.date.git
cd endoflife.date
# Install dependencies (_Note: You must use Bundler 2 or greater_):
$ bundle install
```

Run the site locally:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Browse to `http://localhost:4000` and you should see the site running locally. If you find any errors at this stage, check [Jekyll's troubleshooting page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#configuration-problems) or [ask a question in the Q&A category](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/discussions/new/) on GitHub Discussions.

## File and Directory structure

- The layout for the products page is in `_layouts/post.html`
- Product data is in the `products` directory.
- Automation scripts that fetch latest releases are in the `_auto` directory.
- We follow the Jekyll directory structure:
  - `_includes` holds partial templates, such as the content for the `<head>` tag.
  - `assets` includes CSS/JS/Logo images etc
  - `_plugins` holds scripts invoked by the Jekyll build code
  - `_config.yml` holds the Jekyll configuration, including list of plugins, exclude/include filelist, theme configuration, and plugin settings.
  - `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` are package files for bundler.
- `_headers` holds the template for generating a list of custom HTTP headers, in the Netlify Headers Format. A rendered version (might be dated) of the file can be seen [here](http://hastebin.com/fajomitewu.yaml).
- `_redirects` similarly holds the template for generating redirects from alternate URLs to main product pages, again in the Netlify format. You can see a rendered version [here](http://hastebin.com/gihahuguvu.http).
- `Rakefile` configures the entrypoint for our automation scripts.
- [`robots.txt`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt) is for web scraping robots.
- [`humans.txt`](https://endoflife.date/humans.txt) holds details about the people and tech behind the project.

## Automation

Automation is currently focused towards fetching the latest releases for a given release cycle. Scripts for this are in the `_auto` directory, and run using `Rakefile`.

All scripts should have fallback data in some form.

### GKE

The GKE data is fetched at build-time via GKE APIs by calling `rake gke`.

## API

The API is just a bunch of static files generated by `_plugins/create-json-files.rb` in the `api` directory. The API is not stable, because the key names or release names are not consistent.

### API Documentation

The API Documentation is available at https://endoflife.date/docs/api and is generated from an OpenAPI Specification file located at `_data/openapi.yml`. The documentation is generated using an in-tree version of [jekyll-openapi](https://github.com/robertlove/jekyll-openapi).

## Contributing Workflow

If you just want to add a new product or make some trivial changes, please see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Else:

- Fork the project
- Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
- Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')
- Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
- Create new Pull Request

## Deployment

The code is built and deployed to Netlify under it's Open Source Plan. We use the following Netlify Features:

- Custom HTTP Headers (`_headers` file)
- Custom Redirects (`_redirects` file)

The build script is kept in `netlify.toml`.

## Analytics

There are no javascript trackers or analytics on the website. Netlify Analytics enabled as an experiment. Numbers from Netlify Analytics and Google Search Usability Reports are published on [the wiki](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/wiki)
