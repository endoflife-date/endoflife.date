## <img class="emoji" title=":octocat:" alt=":octocat:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png" width="20" height="20"> Hacktoberfest

This project is participating in Hacktoberfest 2022. If you are looking to contribute, please check out our [detailed guide for hacktoberfest participants](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/issues/408).

## üïê What's this project?

Before you get started, get to know the project a little bit. Open [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date) and browse around a little bit. Take a look at some of these recently merged PRs to get a better idea: [#1598](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/pull/1598), [#1603](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/pull/1603), [#1552](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/pull/1552), [#1596](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/pull/1596).

## :pencil: About the codebase

endoflife.date is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - the Ruby static site builder that powers GitHub Pages. The site is built and deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Since the site is mostly informational, you _don't need programming skills to contribute to the project_.

## :new: Adding a new product

To add a new page to the website, [create a new markdown file with YAML frontmatter](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/new/master/products). Keep the filename as `productname.md`, and please delete any generic comments or unneeded keys before creating a Pull Request. Use the timezone from the upstream product for all dates, wherever possible.

```yaml
---
# Name of the product (mandatory).
title: Timeturner

# Category of the product (mandatory).
# Possible values are os,db,app,lang,framework,device,service,server-app.
# If you add a new value, please mention it on the PR Description. Some rough guidelines:
# - os is for operating systems (and similar projects),
# - db is for databases,
# - app is for end-user applications,
# - lang is for programming languages,
# - framework is for application libraries, SDKs, frameworks...,
# - device is for physical devices,
# - service is for managed service offerings (SaaS/PaaS...),
# - server-app is for applications usually installed on the server-side.
category: os

# Tags of the product (optional).
#
# Tags :
# - must match [a-z0-9\-]+,
# - must be declared with a space-separated string,
# - must be alphabetically ordered,
# - must use singular (for example web-server, not web-servers),
# - should be used at least twice,

#   - set a product vendor such as adobe, amazon or apache,
#   - set a runtime dependency such as java-runtime, javascript-runtime or php-runtime.
#
# Remember that no tag is better than useless tag. Also note that categories are automatically tags, but don't
# use another category as a tag.
tags: amazon linux

# Simple Icons (https://simpleicons.org/) icon slug (optional).
# Remove this property if the icon is not available on Simple Icons.
# As an example, https://simpleicons.org/?q=codemagic links to https://simpleicons.org/icons/codemagic.svg ,
# so the slug is `codemagic` (the SVG filename without extension).

iconSlug: codemagic

# Main URL for the page (mandatory).

# Auto-update release configuration (optional).
# This is used for automatically updating `releaseDate`, `latest`, and `latestReleaseDate` for every release.
# Multiple configuration are allowed.
# Please visit https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/wiki/Automation for more details.
# The presence of such configuration enables a footer note on the product page
# informing users that latest releases are automatically updated.
auto:

  # Configuration for auto-update based on git.
  # Any valid git clone URL will work, but support for partialClone is necessary
  # (GitHub and GitLab support it).
  # For example, for Apache Maven:
  - git: https://github.com/apache/maven.git

    # Ruby-compatible regex that defines how the tags above should translate to releases
    # (optional, default can be found on https://github.com/endoflife-date/release-data/blob/main/update.rb#L19-L20 ).
    # Use named capturing groups to capture the version or version's parts.
    # Default value should work for most releases of the form a.b, a.b.c or 'v'a.b.c. It should also
    # skip over any special releases (such as nightly,beta,pre,rc...).
    regex: ^v(?<major>0|[1-9]\d*)_(?<minor>0|[1-9]\d*)_(?<patch>\d{1,3})_?(?<tiny>\d+)?$

    # A liquid template using the captured variables from the regex above that renders the final version
    # (optional, default can be found on https://github.com/endoflife-date/release-data/blob/main/update.rb#L19-L20 ).
    # You can use liquid templating here.
    template: '{{major}}.{{minor}}.{{patch}}{%if tiny %}p{{tiny}}{%endif%}'

  # Configuration for auto-update based on Docker Hub.
  # The value must be the "owner/repo" combination for a docker hub public image.
  # Use "library" as the owner name for an official docker/community image.
  # For example, for PostgreSQL:
  - dockerhub: library/postgres

  # Configuration for auto-update based on the npm registry.
  # The value must be the package identifier on https://www.npmjs.com .
  # For example, for Vue:
  - npm: vue

  # Configuration for auto-update based on DistroWatch.
  # The value must be the distribution ID. It can be found in the distribution URL.
  # For example, for https://distrowatch.com/index.php?distribution=debian , use "debian".
  - distrowatch: debian

    # The Python-Compatible regex used to parse headlines (mandatory).
    # Use named capturing groups to capture the version or version's parts.
    # You can also pass a list of regexes here, and matches for any of those will be considered.
    regex: 'Distribution Release: (?P<version>\d+.\d+)'

    # A liquid template using the captured variables from the regex above that renders the final version
    # (optional, default can be found on https://github.com/endoflife-date/release-data/blob/main/src/distrowatch.py#L13 ).
    # You can use liquid templating here.
    template: '{{version}}'

  # Configuration for auto-update based on Maven Central ( https://search.maven.org ).
  # The value must be the maven coordinates of the artifact, in the form groupId/artifactId.
  # For example, for Apache Tomcat ( https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat ):
  - maven: org.apache.tomcat/tomcat

  # Configuration for auto-update based on a custom script in release-data repository.
  # The value must always be `true`.
  - custom: true

# A list of identifiers that can be used to detect this product as being used,
# especially by SBOM tooling
identifiers:
  # Each identifier is a way of linking this product to various methods of installing it

  # This is a shorthand to use repology as the source data
  # https://repology.org/project/:package-name-/versions
  # should return a valid list of packages linked to this product.
  - repology: package-name

  # See the PURL spec https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec
  # for details, and avoid packages that are already mentioned on
  # the repology page
  # Common examples would be to use
  # - pkg:os to document operating systems (https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/161)
  # - pkg:github to link to github pages
  # - pkg:golang/pypi/gem/maven/npm etc for common package managers
  # - pkg:docker for linking to docker images on Docker Hub
  - purl: pkg:package-manager/package-name

# A list of releases, supported or not (mandatory).
# Releases must be sort from the newest (on top of the list) to the lowest.
# Do not add releases that are not considered "stable" (such as RC/Alpha/Beta/Nightly).
releases:

    # Release range (mandatory, always put in quotes).
    # This is usually major.minor. Do not prefix with "v" or suffix with ".x".
    # This becomes part of our API URL, so try to avoid spaces and use lowercase for words.
-   releaseCycle: "1.2"

    # Name displayed for the release (optional, default = global releaseLabel value).
    # Use this property if you need to override the release label on a per-release basis.
    # You can use templating here, though it is usually not required.
    # Template parameters are the same as the global releaseLabel property.
    releaseLabel: "Timeturner Firebolt (1.2)"

    # Codename of the release (optional, not displayed anywhere by default).
    # It can be used as __CODENAME__ in the releaseLabel and changelogTemplate.
    # It is also returned as-is in the API.
    codename: firebolt

    # Date of the release (optional if releaseDateColumn is false, else mandatory).
    # It should be removed if releaseDateColumn is false.
    # Note that an approximate date is better than no date at all.
    releaseDate: 2017-03-12

    # End of active support date (optional if activeSupportColumn is false, else mandatory).
    # This is where bugfixes usually stop coming in.
    # Use valid dates, and do not add quotes around dates.
    # Alternatively, set to true|false if the date has not been decided yet.
    support: 2018-01-31

    # EOL date (mandatory).
    # This is where all support stops (including security support).
    # In case there is extended/commercial support available, pick the date that would apply to the
    # majority of users (and use the extendedSupport field if necessary).
    # Use valid dates, and do not add quotes around dates.
    # Alternatively, set to true|false the date has not been decided yet.
    eol: 2019-01-01

    # End of extended/commercial support date (optional if extendedSupportColumn is false, else mandatory).
    # Note that extended/commercial support is different from Long-Term Support. Extended/commercial
    # support must be used only when additional support is available after EOL, usually against payment.
    # Use valid dates, and do not add quotes around dates.
    # Alternatively, set to true|false if the date has not been decided yet.
    extendedSupport: 2020-01-01

    # Latest release for the release cycle (optional if releaseColumn is false, else mandatory).
    # Usually this is the release cycle's latest "patch" release.
    # It should be removed if releaseColumn is false.
    # Always add quotes around this value.
    latest: "1.2.3"

    # Latest release date (optional).
    # Use valid dates, and do not add quotes around dates.
    latestReleaseDate: 2022-01-23

    # Whether this is a "LTS" release (optional, default = false).
    # What LTS means may differ from product to product (see LTSLabel above).
    # Only provide for a release that will get much longer support than usual.
    lts: true

    # Whether this is a "discontinued" release (optional).
    # Can be set to true/false.
    # Only use if discontinuedColumn is set to true.
    discontinued: true

    # A link to the changelog for the latest release
    # (optional, default = the URL generated from changelogTemplate if it is provided).
    # Use this if the link is not predictable (i.e. you can't use changelogTemplate),
    # or if the changelogTemplate generated link must be overridden.
    # Do not use a localized URL (such as one containing en-us) if possible.
    # Use the special value 'null' (unquoted) if you want to disable link for a specific cycle of a
    # product having a changelogTemplate.
    link: https://example.com/news/2021-12-25/release-1.2.3

# In the following markdown section, ensure that all the above are present:
# 1. A one line statement about what the product is, with a link to the primary website (in a quote).
# 2. A short summary of the release policy, pointing out the EoL policy as well, if available.
# 3. Any additional information that may be of interest.
#
# See also the Guiding Principles on the wiki ( https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/wiki/Guiding-Principles )
# for indication on the tone and voice to use for the text.


# Please leave a newline both above and below the triple-dashes.

---

# All the product information text should be under triple-dashes.
# If you are adding any images in the text, they might get blocked due to our CSP.
# So prefer using releaseImage in such cases. Note that images on the same website as releaseImage
# will not be blocked.
