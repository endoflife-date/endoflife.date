## :octocat: Hacktoberfest

This project is participating in Hacktoberfest 2022. If you are looking to contribute, please check out our [detailed guide for hacktoberfest participants](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/issues/408).

## üïê What's this project?

Before you get started, get to know the project a little bit. Open [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date) and browse around a little bit. Take a look at some of these recently merged PRs to get a better idea: [#1598](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/pull/1598), [#1603](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/pull/1603), [#1552](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/pull/1552), [#1596](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/pull/1596).

## :pencil: About the codebase

endoflife.date is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - the Ruby static site builder that powers GitHub Pages. The site is built and deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Since the site is mostly informational, you _don't need programming skills to contribute to the project_.

## :new: Adding a new product

To add a new page to the website, [create a new markdown file with YAML frontmatter](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/new/master/products). Keep the filename as `productname.md`, and please delete any generic comments or unneeded keys before creating a Pull Request. Use the timezone from the upstream product for all dates, wherever possible.

```yaml

# Possible values are os,db,app,lang,framework,device,service,server-app

# db is databases, os is operating systems, lang is programming languages
# app is end-user applications
# lang is programming languages
# framework is used for application libraries, SDKs, frameworks etc
# device is physical devices
# service is managed service offerings (SaaS/PaaS etc)
# server-app are applications usually installed on the server-side

# Template to be used to generate a link for the release
# __RELEASE_CYCLE__ will be replaced by the value of releaseCycle
# __LATEST__ will be replaced by the value of latest
# __CODENAME__ will be replaced by the optional codename

# You can even use Liquid Templating inside the template, such as:
# https://godotengine.org/article/maintenance-release-godot-{{"__LATEST__" | replace:'.','-'}}
# Do not use a localized URL (such as one containing en-us) if possible
changelogTemplate: "https://link/of/the/__RELEASE_CYCLE__/and/__LATEST__/version"

# Default value is `__RELEASE_CYCLE__``
releaseLabel: "MoM Timeturner __RELEASE_CYCLE__ (__CODENAME__)"

# The label that will be used alongside releases labelled with `lts: true`
# Optional, only provide if the product has lts releases that are not called LTS, but something else.

# Optional information about how release information can be fetched automatically
# This is used for automatically updating `releaseDate`, `latest`, and `latestReleaseDate` for

releases:

# As an example, https://simpleicons.org/?q=opensuse links to

# So the slug is `opensuse` (the SVG filename without extension).
iconSlug: ministryofmagic

# A few extra fields define overall page behaviour

# URL for the page

# A list of alternate URLs that will redirect to the permalink. This is nice to let people use easier to remember URLs. For eg, we redirect /golang to /go

releaseDateColumn: true

# What to call the End of Life  (Security Support) column. (optional)

# An image that shows a graphical representation of the releases.

# In the markdown section, ensure that the following are present:
# 1. A one line statement about what the product is, with a link to the primary website (in a quote)
# 2. A short summary of the release policy, pointing out the EoL policy as well, if available.
# 3. Any additional information that may be of interest
# See the Guiding Principles on the wiki (https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/wiki/Guiding-Principles)
# on tone and voice for the text.

# If you are adding any images in the text, they might get blocked due to our CSP
