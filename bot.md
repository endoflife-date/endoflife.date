endoflife.date user agent is the following:

```
endoflife.date-bot/1.0 (endoflife.date automation; +https://endoflife.date/bot)
```

If you are reading this page, you have likely noticed our user agent in your server logs.
We understand that seeing an unfamiliar bot can raise questions. This page clarifies our bot's purpose and practices.

endoflife.date is an open-source community website dedicated to documenting End-of-Life (EOL) dates and support lifecycles for various products.
Our goal is to provide accurate and up-to-date information to help users and organizations plan their software and hardware upgrades effectively.

To help achieve this, we have developed a bot that automates the collection of information from various websites, including yours.
We want to assure you that our bot is designed to be as respectful and non-intrusive as possible.
Here are some key points about our scraping practices:

- **Selective Scraping:** Our bot only scrapes a few selected pages relevant to our mission; it does not indiscriminately crawl entire websites.
- **Respect for Cache Directives:** We respect the cache directives set by your server.
  If none are set, we keep the website page in our cache for one day to minimize requests.

We kindly ask that you continue authorizing our user agent to access your site.
Your cooperation helps us maintain accurate and up-to-date information for the benefit of the entire community.

If you are unable to authorize our bot, we understand and respect your decision.
In such cases, please let us know by opening an issue on our GitHub repository: [endoflife-date/endoflife.date/issues](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/issues).
This will allow us to deactivate our bot for your site and explore alternative ways to collect the necessary information.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

The endoflife.date Team
