description: Some information about the endoflife.date bot - what it is and why it exists.
---

If you are on this page, this means you have noticed our user agent, `endoflife.date-bot/1.0 (endoflife.date automation; +https://endoflife.date/bot)` in your server logs.
We understand that seeing an unfamiliar bot can raise questions, and this page is intended to clarify our bot's purpose and practices.

endoflife.date is an open-source community website dedicated to documenting End-of-Life (EOL) dates and support lifecycles for various products.
Our goal is to provide accurate and up-to-date information to help users and organizations plan their software and hardware upgrades effectively.

To help us achieve this goal, we have developed a bot that automates the collection of information from various websites, including yours.
We want to assure you that our bot is designed to be as respectful and non-intrusive as possible.
Here are some key points about our scraping practices:

- Selective Scraping: Our bot only scrapes a few selected pages that are relevant to our mission.
  We do not indiscriminately crawl entire websites.
- Respect for Cache Directives: We respect the cache directives set by your server.
  If a cache directive is not set, we keep the website page in our cache for one day to minimize the number of requests to your server.

We kindly ask you to keep authorizing our user agent to access your site.
Your cooperation will help us maintain accurate and up-to-date information for the benefit of the entire community.

If, for any reason, it is not possible to authorize our bot, we understand and respect your decision.
In such cases, we would appreciate it if you could let us know by opening an issue on our GitHub repository: [endoflife-date/endoflife.date/issues](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/issues).
This will allow us to deactivate the automation for your site and explore alternative ways to collect the necessary information.

Thank you for your understanding and support,
The endoflife.date Team
