We maintain quick links for checking End Of Life dates for various tools and technologies. Here's a quick list:

- [endoflife.date/alpine](/alpine)
- [endoflife.date/django](/django)
- [endoflife.date/iphone](/iphone)
- [endoflife.date/laravel](/laravel)
- [endoflife.date/php](/php)
- [endoflife.date/python](/python)
- [endoflife.date/rhel](/rhel)
- [endoflife.date/ubuntu](/ubuntu)
- [endoflife.date/windows](/windows)

## Suggestion

The reason this site exists is because this information is very often hidden away. If you're releasing something on a regular basis:

1. List only supported releases.
2. Give EoL dates/policy if possible.
3. Hide unsupported releases behind a few extra clicks.
4. Mention security/active release difference if needed.
